# PhillyTechDude Politics
A personal website to document the political beliefs of a tech bro who did his own research and came to his own conclusions and created his own solutions through his own critical thought. Never in a million years did I think it was in the cards for me to run for office, but at the moment, I'm very strongly considering running to be the next congressman out of PA-03 (Philadelphia)
