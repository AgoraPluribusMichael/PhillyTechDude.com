              I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering running for office in 2026 to represent PA-03 in Congress, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer by harming our society, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and write laws to help serve the common good.

              I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
