            <h3>And Stop Trying to Raise the Cap When We Don't Have the Votes</h3>
            <p>
              Because Social Security itself is procedurally difficult to change, the best way to save Social Security is to set up parallel programs that work in tandem with Social Security to ensure that any American can retire with dignity.
            </p>
            <p>
              These policies are intended to be advanced in parallel (but not necessarily in the same bill) similar to the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684" target="_blank">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> (regular order) and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376" target="_blank">Inflation Reduction Act</a> (reconciliation) from the 117th Congress (both signed into law by President Biden during his first 2 years in office).

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="hsa-expansion">Let's Provide Health Savings Accounts for All Children</h2>
            <h3>And Invest in Small Businesses at the Same Time</h3>
            <p>
              The first proposal is to expand Health Savings Account (HSA) eligibility to all children (stretch goal: also adults under 26), allow parents and legal guardians to make tax-deferred contributions to the account, seed the account at birth, and invest the funds in a US-Treasury-managed small cap index fund (with a strong value factor tilt), running at a negative expense ratio.
            </p>
            <p>
              Investing in small, under-valued businesses is surely better than investing in the large corporations. And this cannot be construed as a privatization of Social Security, because the filibuster makes it impossible for a simple majority of Republican senators to cut Social Security.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="basic-income">Let's Expand Social Security with Basic Income</h2>
            <h3>A Plan-B Program for the Eventuality that Social Security Runs Out of Money</h3>
            <p>
              The second proposal is to implement a new Basic Income program that initially mimics the structure of Social Security in every way but name, to be funded by a wealth gains tax on the top 1%. Furthermore, we can set up a Basic Income Trust Fund and make the dispersal of funds contingent on the total depletion of the Social Security Trust Fund.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we set up this kind of Basic Income program, it is okay for the Social Security Trust Fund to run out of money, since we'll have it in reserve. I would even argue that such a program is better than Social Security, since the idea of using a wealth tax to fund Basic Income has appeal outside the duopoly and opens up the opportunity for an expansion of Basic Income in the future. And as someone of Japanese descent who has a living relative that spent some of her childhood in one of FDR's internment camps, I personally wouldn't be too upset if Social Security collapsed, so long as we have a more modern Plan B that's waiting in the wings, ready to pick up the pieces.
