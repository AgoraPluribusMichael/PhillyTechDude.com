          <h1>Let's Save Social Security</h1>
          <h2>A Bipartisan Proposal to Modernize the Flagship American Pension Program</h2>

          <section class="top-margin">
            <div style="padding:20px">
              <section class="info-summary-panel">
                <h2 class="info-title">Let's Try a New Approach</h2>
                <h3 class="info-subtitle">And Stop Trying to Raise the Cap When We Don't Have the Votes</h3>

                <p>
                  Because Social Security itself is procedurally difficult to change, the best way to save Social Security is to set up parallel programs that work in tandem with Social Security to ensure that any American can retire with dignity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These policies are intended to be advanced in parallel (but not necessarily in the same bill) similar to the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684" target="_blank">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> (regular order) and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376" target="_blank">Inflation Reduction Act</a> (reconciliation) from the 117th Congress (both signed into law by President Biden during his first 2 years in office).

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="hsa-expansion">Let's Provide Health Savings Accounts for All Children</h2>
            <h3>And Invest in Small Businesses at the Same Time</h3>
            <p>
              The first proposal is to expand Health Savings Account (HSA) eligibility to all children (stretch goal: also adults under 26), allow parents and legal guardians to make tax-deferred contributions to the account, seed the account at birth, and invest the funds in a US-Treasury-managed small cap index fund (with a strong value factor tilt), running at a negative expense ratio.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>This is not a privatization of Social Security</b>, because the filibuster makes it impossible for a simple majority of Republican senators to cut funding to Social Security. In other words, <b>this would be a privatized expansion of Social Security</b>. And besides, <b>investing in under-valued small businesses is far better than corporate welfare</b>, not just because of the small-cap value premium, but also because small businesses profit by helping society, whereas large corporations profit by destroying millions of jobs.

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="basic-income">Let's Protect, Expand, and Modernize Social Security with Basic Income</h2>
            <h3>A Plan-B Program for When Social Security Runs Out of Money</h3>
            <p>
              The second proposal is to implement a new Basic Income program that initially mimics the structure of Social Security in every way but name, to be funded by a wealth gains tax on the top 1%. Furthermore, we can set up a Basic Income Trust Fund and make the dispersal of funds contingent on the total depletion of the Social Security Trust Fund.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we set up this kind of Basic Income program, it is okay for the Social Security Trust Fund to run out of money. I would even argue that Basic Income is better than Social Security, since the idea of using a wealth tax to fund tax relief has appeal outside the duopoly and opens up the opportunity for an expansion of Basic Income in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              And as someone of Japanese descent who has a living relative that spent some of her childhood in one of FDR's internment camps, I will say that <b>if we can create a new Basic Income program that mimics Social Security, then I personally wouldn't be too upset if Social Security collapsed</b>, because we'll have a modern Plan-B program that's waiting in the wings, ready to pick up the pieces on day one.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this way, we can <b>gradually repeal and replace Social Security with a Basic Income system designed for the 21st Century, without any interruption to the vital service for our seniors</b>.

              I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering running for office in 2026 to represent PA-3 in Congress, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and write laws to help serve the common good.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
