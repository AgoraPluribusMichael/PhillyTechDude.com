          <h2>A Bipartisan Proposal to Modernize the Flagship American Pension Program</h2>

            <div style="padding:20px">
              <section class="info-summary-panel">
                <h2 class="info-title">Let's Try a New Approach</h2>
                <h3 class="info-subtitle">And Stop Trying to Raise the Cap When We Don't Have the Votes</h3>

                <p>
                  Because Social Security itself is procedurally difficult to change, the best way to save Social Security is to set up parallel programs that work in tandem with Social Security to ensure that any American can retire with dignity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These policies are intended to be advanced in parallel (but not necessarily in the same bill) similar to the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684" target="_blank">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> (regular order) and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376" target="_blank">Inflation Reduction Act</a> (reconciliation) from the 117th Congress (both signed into law by President Biden during his first 2 years in office).

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="hsa-expansion">Let's Provide Health Savings Accounts for All Children</h2>
            <h3>And Invest in Small Businesses at the Same Time</h3>
            <p>
              The first proposal is to provide <b>Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for all children</b> (stretch goal: also adults under 26), allow <b></b>parents and legal guardians to make tax-deferred contributions</b> to the account, <b>seed the account at birth</b>, and invest the funds in a <b>US-Treasury-managed high-yield small cap bond fund</b> (with a strong <b>value factor tilt</b>), running at a <b>negative expense ratio</b>. It is worth mentioning that <b>This is not public ownership of small businesses</b> â€” bonds are loans, not stocks; they donâ€™t confer ownership, control, or voting rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>This would be a private-sector expansion of Social Security, not a privatization of Social Security</b>, because the filibuster makes it impossible for a simple majority of Republican senators to cut funding to Social Security. And besides, <b>investing in under-valued small businesses is far better than corporate welfare</b>, not just because of the small-cap value premium, but also because small businesses profit by helping society, whereas large corporations profit by destroying millions of jobs.

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="basic-income">Let's Protect, Expand, and Modernize Social Security with Basic Income</h2>
            <h3>A Plan-B Program for When Social Security Runs Out of Money</h3>
            <p>
              The second proposal is to implement a new <b>Basic Income program that initially mimics the structure of Social Security</b> in every way but name. Furthermore, we can set up a <b>Basic Income Trust Fund</b> and make the <b>dispersal of funds contingent on the total depletion of the Social Security Trust Fund</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we set up this kind of Basic Income program, it is okay for the Social Security Trust Fund to run out of money. I would even argue that Basic Income is better than Social Security, since the idea of using a wealth tax to fund tax relief has appeal outside the duopoly and opens up the opportunity for an expansion of Basic Income in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              And as an American of Japanese descent, who has a living relative that spent some of her childhood in one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans" target="_blank">FDR's internment camps</a>, I will say that <b>if we can create a new Basic Income program that mimics Social Security, then I personally wouldn't be too upset if we allowed the Social Security Trust Fund to deplete</b>, because we'll then have a modern Plan-B program that's waiting in the wings, ready to pick up the pieces on day one.
            </p>
            <p>
              It will always be difficult to change Social Security, so there's a possibility it will stick around for a while. (Also, what's to stop the program from running at a deficit, like the entire government has for basically my whole life?) But if we can create a Basic Income system that's funded through wealth taxes or corporate taxes instead of payroll taxes, then there may be a reason to <b>gradually repeal and replace Social Security with a Basic Income system designed for the 21st Century, without any interruption to the vital service for our seniors</b>,

              I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering getting into public policy, advocacy, or even running for office, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and write laws to help serve the common good.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
