          <h1>Let's Save Social Security</h1>
          <h2>A Bipartisan Proposal to Modernize the Flagship American Pension Program</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          When Social Security was first created in 1935, it dramatically reduced poverty among the elderly. To this
          day, it remains one of the most successful programs in American history ‚Äî allowing seniors to spend their
          golden years with dignity after a lifetime of hard work and service to the American public.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, Social Security is facing mounting pressure from two converging trends: a historic wave of <b>Baby
            Boomers entering retirement</b> and a steady <b>rise in life expectancy</b>. As more Americans collect
          benefits for longer periods, the Social Security Trust Fund is starting to disperse benefits faster than it
          can collect new taxes. And yet, despite widespread concern, Congress remains gridlocked ‚Äî because <b>any
            change to the funding of Social Security requires a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate</b>, making even
          bipartisan reforms procedurally out of reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>If we cannot increase funding to the program to match the growing number of beneficiaries, the Social
            Security Trust Fund will deplete, leading to reduced benefits and jeopardizing the financial security of
            millions of seniors</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the answer is not to eliminate the filibuster. It's a double-edged sword; while the filibuster prevents us
          from easily raising Social Security taxes, it also protects the program from a simple majority of Republican
          senators from cutting the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Social Security itself is procedurally difficult to change, <b>the best way to save it is to set up
            parallel programs that work in tandem</b> to ensure that any American can retire with dignity and comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two policies are intended to be advanced in parallel (but not necessarily in the same bill) similar to
          the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684" target="_blank">Infrastructure
            Investment and Jobs Act</a> (regular order) and the <a
            href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376" target="_blank">Inflation Reduction
            Act</a> (reconciliation) from the 117th Congress (both signed into law by President Biden during his first 2
          years in office).

          <h2 class="section-header" id="hsa-expansion">Let's Provide Health Savings Accounts for All Children</h2>
          <h3>And Invest in American Prosperity at the Same Time</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The first proposal is to provide <b>Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for all children</b> (stretch goal: also
          adults under 26), allow <b>parents and legal guardians to make tax-deferred contributions</b> to the account,
          <b>seed the account at birth</b>, and invest the funds in the <a
            href="new_globalism.html#societal-bond-fund">Great Societal Bond Fund</a>. The interest income would not be
          reinvested, and instead be deposited into the settlement fund of the account, where they would be held in U.S.
          Treasury bonds or money market funds. <b>Account holders would be allowed to reinvest into the bond fund</b>,
          or even set up automatic reinvestments, but <b>they would not be able to sell any bonds</b>. Withdrawals could
          then be made from the settlement fund under the same conditions as current HSA rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>This would be an expansion of Social Security, not a privatization</b>, because the filibuster makes it
          effectively impossible for a simple majority of Republican senators to cut funding to the program. And unlike
          blank-check corporate welfare, lending to underfinanced small businesses, students, and construction workers
          through bonds supports the real economy instead of corporate America.

          <h2 class="section-header" id="basic-income">Let's Protect, Expand, and Modernize Social Security with Basic
            Income</h2>
          <h3>A Plan-B Program for When Social Security Runs Out of Money</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The second proposal is to implement a new <b>Basic Income program that initially mimics the structure of
            Social Security</b> in every way but name. Furthermore, we can set up a <b>Basic Income Trust Fund</b> and
          make the <b>dispersal of funds contingent on the total depletion of the Social Security Trust Fund</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we can set up this kind of Basic Income program, then it is okay for Social Security to run out of money. I
          would even argue that Basic Income is better than Social Security, since the idea of using a wealth tax to
          fund tax relief has appeal outside the duopoly and opens up the opportunity for an expansion of Basic Income
          in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as an American of Japanese descent, who has a living relative that spent some of her childhood in one of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans" target="_blank">FDR's internment
            camps</a>, I will say that <b>if ‚Äî and only if ‚Äî we can create a parallel program that mimics Social
            Security, then I personally wouldn't be too upset if we allowed the Social Security Trust Fund to
            deplete</b>, because we'll then have a modern Plan-B program that's waiting in the wings, ready to offset a
          reduction in benefits on day one.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will always be difficult to change Social Security, so there's a possibility it will stick around for a
          while in its current form. (Also, what's to stop the program from running at a deficit, like the entire
          government has for basically my whole life? <span style="font-family: Courier;">¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</span>) It would
          probably make the most sense to start out by assuming we would fund Basic Income by hiking income taxes on
          high earners, since that would be logically equivalent to raising the cap on Social Security payroll taxes.
          But it would be even better if we could instead fund it through <a
            href="taxes.html#robin-hood-tax-credit">capital gains taxes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we can
          eventually shift away from payroll taxes, then there may be a reason one day to <b>gradually repeal and
            replace Social Security with a Basic Income system designed for the 21st Century, without any interruption
            to the vital service for our seniors</b>.

        Hi! I'm Michael Yee, a software engineer, entrepreneur, music producer, and digital artist who lives in South Philly. After six years of working in the private sector, I quit my day job
        to launch my startup company Agora Pluribus Technologies, with the goal of using my sklls to empower ordinary
        people, because I want to be a part of the solution, not the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up
        waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world
        devolves into madness.
