          <h1>Consumer Protection Interstate Compact</h1>
          <p>
            We can work collectively with other states who want to protect consumers (I'm thinking California + whoever else), to create an interstate compact designed to act as a treaty to guide state government action. Together, we can cap credit card interchange fees and interest rates, protect the right to repair, eliminate the proliferation of microplastics and carcinogens, and reduce landfill waste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if not all states participate, a coalition of populous blue states can force the corporations to play by the rules if they want to be competitive in American markets. Let's ban corporations from harming our society for profit.

          <h1>21st Amendment Interstate Compact</h1>
          <p>
            Let's create an interstate compact to guide state-level governance to align with the spirit of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, which repealed the prohibition of alcohol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, this is me trying to find a way to force the state government to modernize the PA state liquor control board. I'm a young man, and I want my liquor!

          <h1>A Constitutional Argument for a Pennsylvania-Delaware Reciprocity Agreement</h1>
          <p>
            As a Philadelphian who works across the border in Delaware, not only do I have to travel longer distances to get to work, which means I pay more in gas and time, but also I pay more in taxes, too, because I get taxed at the Delaware state income tax rates, with the highest marginal rate at 6.6%, instead of Pennsylvania's flat 3.07% rate. And furthermore, none of those taxes go to Pennsylvania. It all goes to Delaware. And the Delaware state government knows this full well, and this is the reason why we have not had a reciprocity agreement between our states. It's because Delaware likes the free money off the backs of working Philadelphians. It is beyond unfair for Philadelphians to pay more in taxes just because we work across the border. Why should we pay more in taxes than someone working a similar job in Harrisburg? It's even unconstitutional, in violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees that citizens of one state cannot be unfairly burdened by another.
          </p>
          <p>
            On behalf of Philadelphians who work across the border, I am calling on Governor Shapiro and Governor Meyer to work out a reciprocity agreement. In the meantime, Philadelphians can fight back by maxing out tax-deferred contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and/or HSA.

          <h1>911 SAVES Act</h1>
          <p>
            As of now, 911 dispatchers are not classified as first responders on the federal level, so they are ineligible to receive first responder benefits even though they have an extremely emotionally taxing job. One call might be from a prank caller, while the next one could be a high-stakes life or death scenario. It's time to pass the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/637">911 SAVES Act</a> to allow 911 dispatchers to receive health benefits.
