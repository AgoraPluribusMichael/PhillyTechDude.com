                  Here is a list of policies that I've engineered myself, not as an expert, but as a layman and freedom-minded tech dude who came up with my own solutions and formed my own opinions through my own research and own critical thought.

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="out-of-network">Blue Shield United Health Network Interstate Compact</h2>
            <p>
              Let's establish a compact among states to agree to <b>ban private insurance companies from considering any medical services that are operating within participating states to be "out-of-network."</b> What the hell is "out-of-network?!" The money we give them every month isn't out of network, but somehow the service that we're actually paying for can be deemed "out-of-network?"
            </p>
            <p>
              This one's personal for me, because when my appendix started giving me problems at work (I had "smoldering" appendicitis instead of the normal acute one), I immediately started driving home, and when the pain became unbearable, I drove straight to a hospital that, unfortunately, was out-of-network. Luckily, after I signed an Against Medical Advice (AMA) form, I was able to be driven to Crozer Chester Medical Center, a for-profit hospital that recently went out of business because it is unprofitable to serve the poor.
            </p>
            <h3 id="societal-pessimism">On Vigilantism, Extremism, Conspiracies, and Despair</h3>
            <p>
              Incidentally, I was on a UnitedHealthcare plan at the time I drove to the hospital that was out-of-network. And I strongly condemn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Brian_Thompson" target="_blank">blatant murder in broad daylight on the streets of New York City</a>, especially when <b>there exist perfectly peaceful and legal ways to reform the health insurance industry</b>, which is what I'm trying to do. But this points to a broader phenomenon, where if the government and proper authorities don't do their job, then there is a risk for vigilantes to come out of the woodwork and pursue their own version of so-called "justice." In this way, I view vigilantism as a policy failure.
            </p>
            <p>
              But to dig down deeper, I truly believe that this form of vigilantism fits into a larger pattern: people risk being sucked into extreme political ideologies and bizarre conspiracy theories when they lose faith in society. Anarchists have lost faith in the government, ecosocialists have lost faith in the economy, and populists have lost faith in the establishment. In fact, I almost went down the road of voluntaryist libertarianism in 2020, when the Trump Administration so thoroughly bungled its response to the pandemic, that even some of Trump's most ardent supporters were calling it a "plandemic," as if it were so assured that Trump would fail to respond competently that someone could have planned COVID-19 to sink his re-election campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for the conspiracies, I hypothesize that people who become the victims of extreme tragedy or trauma find it more comforting to believe that <i>someone</i> is in control. And it's a negative feedback loop, as the third-party ideologies and bizarre conspiracy theories can be so off-putting to the general public, that it can result in chronic isolation, delusion, and despair.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, I view extremism, despair, cynicism, and isolation, on some level, as symptoms of existential societal rot, which paves the way for oppressive "strong-man" authoritarianism. In this way, <b>the widespread loss of faith in our society is the biggest policy failure of our times</b>.

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="consumer-protection">Consumer Protection Interstate Compact</h2>
            <p>
              Let's establish an interstate compact designed to guide state-level governance to protect American consumers from corporate-sponsored terrorism. (I'm thinking California + whoever else.) Together, we can <b>cap credit card interchange fees and interest rates, protect the right to repair, eliminate the proliferation of microplastics and carcinogens, reduce landfill waste, and punish large corporations for outsourcing jobs.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if not all states participate, a coalition of populous blue states can force the corporations to play by the rules if they want to be competitive in American markets. Let's ban corporations from harming our society for profit.

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="plcb">21st Amendment Interstate Compact</h2>
            <p>
              Let's create an interstate compact to guide state-level governance to align with the spirit of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, which repealed the prohibition of alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, this is me trying to find a way to force my state government to <b>modernize the Pennsylvania state liquor control board</b>. I'm a young man, and I want my liquor!

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="pa-de-reciprocity">Pennsylvania-Delaware Tax Reciprocity Agreement</h2>
            <h3>A Constitutional Argument</h3>
            <p>
              As a Philadelphian who works across the border in Delaware, not only do I have to travel longer distances to get to work, which means I pay more in gas and time, but also I pay more in taxes, too, because I get taxed at the Delaware state income tax rates, with the highest marginal rate at 6.6%, instead of Pennsylvania's flat 3.07% rate. And furthermore, none of those taxes go to Pennsylvania. It all goes to Delaware. And the Delaware state government knows this full well, and this is the reason why we have not had a reciprocity agreement between our states. It's because Delaware likes the free money off the backs of working Philadelphians. It is beyond unfair for Philadelphians to pay more in taxes just because we work across the border. Why should we pay more in taxes than someone working a similar job in Harrisburg?
            </p>
            <p>
              It's even unconstitutional, in violation of the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#4-2:~:text=The%20Citizens%20of%20each%20State%20shall%20be%20entitled%20to%20all%20Privileges%20and%20Immunities%20of%20Citizens%20in%20the%20several%20States." target="_blank">Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, Section 2</a> of the Constitution, which guarantees that <b>citizens of one state cannot be unfairly burdened by another</b>.

                <h3 class="info-subtitle">Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution</h3>
                <p class="info-text">

            <p>
              On behalf of Philadelphians who work across the border, I am calling on Governor Shapiro and Governor Meyer to work out a reciprocity agreement. In the meantime, Philadelphians can fight back by maxing out tax-deferred contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and/or HSA.

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="911-saves">Existing Bills that I Support</h2>
            <h3>911 SAVES Act</h3>
            <p>
              As of now, 911 dispatchers are not classified as first responders on the federal level, so they are ineligible to receive first responder benefits even though they have an extremely emotionally taxing job. One call might be from a prank caller, while the next one could be a high-stakes life or death scenario. There is already momentum on Capitol Hill to pass the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/637" target="_blank">911 SAVES Act</a> to <b>allow 911 dispatchers to receive the same health benefits as other emergency workers</b>.

              I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering running for office in 2026 to represent PA-3 in Congress, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer by harming our society, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and write laws to help serve the common good.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
