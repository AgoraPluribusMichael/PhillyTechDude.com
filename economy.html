          <h1>Let's Build a David vs. Goliath Economy</h1>
          <h2>Run by Small Business Owners, Not the Corporations Who Are Ruining America for Profit</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          There is an extraordinarily powerful idea in economics that won a Nobel Prize in 2013. <b>Any investment in
            systemically undervalued American small businesses will grow faster than investments in the largest
            corporations on Earth</b>. Economists call this the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model" target="_blank">small-cap value
            premium</a>. I call it the American Dream. But it's not looking so good for the small-cap value premium
          these days. Many economists are starting to ask:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Is the small-cap value premium dead? Is the American Dream dead?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's largest corporations are no longer engines of innovation or prosperity ‚Äî they're engines of
          exploitation and subjugation. Driven by the relentless pressure to maximize shareholder profits, they destroy
          thousands of jobs through outsourcing, automation, and layoffs. They inflate prices, shrink the sizes of their
          products
          while charging the same amount, erode local economies,
          and treat workers as liabilities instead of assets. The result is a society hollowed out by corporate
          cost-cutting ‚Äî a system where <b>it is more profitable for corporations to damage our society than to serve
            the American public</b>. It's not personal; it's just business.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in a functioning capitalist society, it should be possible and encouraged for businesses to profit by
          better serving the community. Luckily, there is a good alternative. <b>Small businesses tend to increase
            profits from increased revenues, not reduced costs</b>. Small businesses scale up, serve more customers,
          improve their products, and foster a sense of community.
        </p>
        <p>
          So there's no excuse why our government keeps on acting on behalf of corporate America while crushing the
          dreams of small business owners. <b>If we invest in undervalued small businesses,</b> not only will <b>our
            economy grow
            faster than before,</b> but <b>we will create
            jobs, empower local communities, and restore the economy as a free-market engine for social mobility
            and public service that serve the people, not just the powerful</b>.

            American Twist</h2>
          <h3>During a National Emergency, Wall Street Should Bail Out Main Street, Not the Other Way Around</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          <b>During the pandemic, employers laid off thousands of workers</b>, sending the national unemployment rate
          soaring to its highest level since the Great Depression. And the truth is, <b>it didn‚Äôt need to happen</b>.
          Many of these employers could have kept their teams intact, but chose instead to slash labor costs to protect
          their bottom line. In other words, corporate America profited by plunging thousands of families into chaos ‚Äî
          many of whom relied on employment for their health insurance ‚Äî during the worst public health emergency in a
          century.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best solution to prevent mass layoffs during the next national emergency is a policy known as
          <b>short-time work, or <i>Kurzarbeit</i></b>, pioneered in Germany with remarkable success. The idea is
          simple: employers will try to cut labor costs anyway. But instead of laying off workers, they are allowed to
          temporarily reduce the working hours of their full-time staff. The government then steps in to subsidize the
          reduced wages. Read more about this policy <a
            href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/06/11/na061120-kurzarbeit-germanys-short-time-work-benefit"
            target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the American version I‚Äôm proposing, we take the same core principle, but we do it in a way that empowers
          workers directly. <b>Rather than reimbursing employers for the lost wages, the government would send direct
            Andrew-Yang-style stimulus checks</b> to affected workers, just like the payments issued under President
          Trump's COVID relief bill or President Biden‚Äôs American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. This way, families stay
          afloat, employers stay flexible, and the economy keeps running ‚Äî without funneling funds through corporate
          gatekeepers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To fund the stimulus checks, I propose we enact a <b>tax on unrealized capital gains, not income</b>.

            Economy</h2>
          <h3>By Aggregating Small Business Loans into a High-Yield Bond Fund</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          To empower local economies and strengthen the foundation of American entrepreneurship, I propose aggregating
          government-backed small business loans into a new class of high-yield fixed-income instruments ‚Äî all held
          within the <a href="new_globalism.html#societal-bond-fund">Great Societal Bond Fund</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's how it would work: The federal government already supports thousands of small businesses through loan
          guarantees administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA), including programs like 7(a), 504, and
          microloans. While these loans are underwritten on an individual basis, we can pool thousands of them into
          securitized bundles that resemble high-yield corporate bonds ‚Äî but with one key difference: their proceeds
          directly finance real businesses in American communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is noteworthy to state that this is not public ownership of small businesses ‚Äî bonds are loans, not
          stocks; they don't confer ownership, control, or voting rights. In other words, <b>small business loans would
            increase corporate
            competition, not corporate communism</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These bonds would be designed to offer <b>competitive returns for investors worldwide</b>, while remaining
          anchored in the productive real economy. Unlike junk bonds that fuel corporate buybacks or speculative
          acquisitions, these high-yield societal bonds would generate income from main street businesses that hire
          workers, provide services, and reinvest in their local regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fund would be professionally managed and transparently disclosed, with strict creditworthiness thresholds
          and regulatory oversight. If successful, it would serve a dual purpose ‚Äî <b>stimulating grassroots economic
            growth</b> while also <b>diversifying and strengthening the asset base of the <a
              href="new_globalism.html#societal-bond-fund" target="_blank">Great Societal Bond Fund</a></b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is capitalism that works for everyone. Not just for hedge funds and large corporations ‚Äî but for corner
          stores, startup founders, immigrant-owned bakeries, and small-town manufacturers. It's a bottom-up investment
          in the real American economy, powered by the same financial tools that Wall Street already uses every day.

            with Zero-Interest Loans</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Let's increase funding to the Small Business Administration to <b>offer microloans to aspiring entrepreneurs
            and small business owners at a 0% interest rate</b>. I'm a really big fan of the zero-interest loans
          administered by <a href="https://www.kiva.org/" target="_blank">Kiva</a>, and I think that the federal
          government should do this on a much larger scale.
        </p>
        <p>

          that be a 15% minimum corporate tax similar to the one passed in the <a

        Hi! I'm Michael Yee, a software engineer, entrepreneur, music producer, and digital artist who lives in South Philly. After six years of working in the private sector, I quit my day job
        to launch my startup company Agora Pluribus Technologies, with the goal of using my sklls to empower ordinary
        people, because I want to be a part of the solution, not the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up
        waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world
        devolves into madness.
