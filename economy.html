          <h1>The David vs. Goliath Economy</h1>
          <h2>Let's Stand Up for Small Businesses, not Corporate Interests</h2>
          <p>
            There is an extraordinarily powerful idea in economics that won a Nobel Prize a few decades ago. When investing in the stock market, if you were to solely invest in American small businesses who are systemically undervalued by the broader economy, then your portfolio would grow faster <b>in the long run</b> than if you had instead invested entirely into the largest corporations on Earth. Economists call this the small-cap value premium. I call it the American Dream.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's not looking so good for the small-cap value premium these days. Many economists are starting to ask: Is the small-cap value premium dead? Is the American Dream dead?
          </p>
          <p>
            In theory, the profits earned by a business are supposed to roughly quantify the value they provide society. But there has been a decades-long trend of large corporations making decisions that harm our society for the sake of boosting the bottom line. Corporations shipped manufacturing jobs overseas to China for profit. They lay off workers and try to automate away jobs with AI to cut labor costs. They shrink the sizes of their products while charging the same amount. They degrade the quality of their products with cheap materials and planned obsolescence. Small businesses, on the other hand, become a centerpiece of their community, fostering a sense of togetherness. Small businesses usually increase their profits from increased service to their community. And according to the small-cap value premium, the small undervalued businesses of America will even grow faster by market cap than the biggest corporations. So there's no excuse why our government keeps on acting on behalf of corporate America while the dreams of small business owners are crushed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is long past time that the government helps out small businesses instead of corporate interests. We can nurture an economy that rewards hard work, innovation, and growth instead of corporate complacency and stagnation. We can reward the businesses run by passionate, hard-working members of the community who are just trying to make a difference instead of the CEOs in corporate board rooms looking for the next opportunity to profit off the misery of millions.
          </p>

          <h1>China Stole our Futures Away - It's Time for a Green New Deal</h1>
          <p>
            Over the past several decades, corporations have shipped entire industries overseas, hollowing out previously bustling industrial towns around America and leading to the xenophobic animosity, anti-immigrant sentiments, and protectionist instincts that are commonplace in our society today. This is why, to this day, China is the number one producer of greenhouse gases in the world. The CEOs of large corporations hollowed out entire cities for a profit, and it's time we rebuild on our own terms. We can restore American manufacturing with a massive green infrastructure project. We can revitalize industrial America, and the very people who profited by shipping the American Dream overseas to China should pay for the Green New Deal -- the wealthy, not the high earners.
            
            Now most mainstream Democratic politicians are afraid appearing racist and socialist, so they shy away from this policy. Well not me; I'm a Chinese American, who is not only a <a href="taxes.html">capitalist</a>, but believes that we need to fight to restore the prosperity of the working class by any means necessary. And if American "socialism" can steal back the future that Chinese communism stole from us, then count me in!
            
            As we've seen with the tariffs, we can't un-globalize the economy. But we can channel that anger to rebuild our society instead of lashing out against our allies. We must be able to stand up for the large swaths of Americans who are economically disadvantaged due to recent macroeconomic trends -- the globalization of the economy -- and not just those who were historically oppressed for surface-level identitarian reasons. We can and must do both. And while we can't go back in time, we can fight hard to restore the prosperity of the forgotten men and women of America.
