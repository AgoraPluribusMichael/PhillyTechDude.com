          <h3>Let's Invest in Small Business Owners, not Corporate Interests</h3>
          <p>
            There is an extraordinarily powerful idea in economics that won a Nobel Prize in 2013. When investing in the stock market, if you were to solely invest in American small businesses who are systemically undervalued by the broader economy, then your portfolio would grow faster <b>in the long run</b> than if you had instead invested entirely into the largest corporations on Earth. Economists call this the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model" target="_blank">small-cap value premium</a>. I call it the American Dream.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's not looking so good for the small-cap value premium these days. Many economists are starting to ask: Is the small-cap value premium dead? Is the American Dream dead?
          </p>
          <p>
            In theory, the profits earned by a business are supposed to roughly quantify the value they provide society. But there has been a decades-long trend of large corporations making decisions that harm our society for the sake of boosting the bottom line. Corporations ship manufacturing jobs overseas to China, lay off workers, and try to automate away jobs with AI to cut labor costs. They shrink the sizes of their products while charging the same amount. They degrade the quality of their products with cheap materials and planned obsolescence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Small businesses, on the other hand, foster a sense of togetherness in their communities while increasing their profits from increased revenues, not destructive cost-cutting. And according to the small-cap value premium, the small undervalued businesses of America will even grow faster by market cap than the biggest corporations. So there's no excuse why our government keeps on acting on behalf of corporate America while crushing the dreams of small business owners.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is long past time that the government helps out small businesses instead of protecting and enabling corporate interests. We can nurture an economy that rewards hard work, innovation, and growth instead of corporate complacency and stagnation. We can reward the businesses run by passionate, hard-working members of the community who are just trying to make a difference to achieve the American Dream instead of the CEOs in corporate board rooms looking for the next opportunity to profit off the misery of millions. Only then, can we fully realize the greatness of American capitalism.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section top-margin" id="green-new-deal">Let's Put America First With a Green New Deal</h2>
          <h3>Together, We Can Restore the Industrial Midwest to its Former Glory</h3>
          <p>
            Over the past several decades, corporations have shipped American manufacturing overseas, hollowing out previously bustling industrial towns around America and leading to the xenophobic animosity, anti-immigrant sentiments, and protectionist instincts that are commonplace in our society today. This is why, to this day, China is the number one producer of greenhouse gases in the world, by far. The CEOs of large corporations destroyed the dreams of entire cities for a profit, and it's time we rebuild on our own terms. We can revitalize industrial America with a massive green infrastructure project, to be paid for in full by the very people who profited by shipping the jobs overseas — the wealthy, not the high earners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now most mainstream Democratic politicians are afraid appearing racist and socialist, so they shy away from this policy. Well not me; I'm a Chinese American, who is not only a <a href="taxes.html" target="_blank">capitalist</a>, but believes that we need to fight to restore the prosperity of the working class by any means necessary. And if American "socialism" can steal back the future that Chinese communism stole from us, then count me in, comrade!
          </p>
          <p>
            As we've seen with the tariffs, we can't un-globalize the economy. But we can channel that anger to rebuild our society instead of lashing out and committing economic acts of terror against our allies around the world. We must be able to stand up for the large swaths of Americans who are economically disadvantaged due to recent macroeconomic trends — the globalization of the economy — and not just those who were historically oppressed for surface-level identitarian reasons. We can and must do both. And while we can't go back in time, I believe fully in a clean-energy American future, not the Beijing smog. We can fight hard to restore the prosperity of the forgotten men and women of America, ensuring that anyone — regardless of race, gender, creed, or class — can achieve the American Dream.
