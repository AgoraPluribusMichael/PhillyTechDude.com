            <h3>Let's Invest in Small Business Owners, not the Corporations Who are Ruining America for Profit</h3>
            <p>
              There is an extraordinarily powerful idea in economics that won a Nobel Prize in 2013. <b>Any investment in systemically undervalued American small businesses will grow faster than investments in the largest corporations on Earth</b>. Economists call this the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model" target="_blank">small-cap value premium</a>. I call it the American Dream.
            </p>
            <p>
              But it's not looking so good for the small-cap value premium these days. Many economists are starting to ask: Is the small-cap value premium dead? Is the American Dream dead?
            </p>
            <p>
              In theory, the profits earned by a business are supposed to roughly quantify the value they provide society. But there has been a decades-long trend where <b>large corporations make decisions that harm our society for the sake of boosting the bottom line</b>. Corporations ship manufacturing jobs overseas to China, lay off workers, and try to automate away jobs with AI to cut labor costs. They shrink the sizes of their products while charging the same amount. They degrade the quality of their products with cheap materials and planned obsolescence.
            </p>
            <p>
              But in a functioning capitalist society, it should be possible and encouraged for businesses to profit by serving our society. <b>Small businesses increase profits from increased revenues, not destructive cost-cutting</b>. So there's no excuse why our government keeps on acting on behalf of corporate America while crushing the dreams of small business owners.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is long past time that the government helps out small businesses instead of protecting and enabling corporate interests. <b>We can nurture an economy that rewards the hard work, innovation, and growth of small business owners instead of protecting and enabling the CEOs in corporate board rooms who are looking for the next opportunity to profit off the misery of millions.</b> Only then, can we fully realize the greatness of American capitalism and revive its ability to allow anyone with the next million-dollar idea to achieve the American Dream.

            <h3>Together, We Can Restore the Industrial Midwest to its Former Glory</h3>
            <p>
              Over the past several decades, corporations have shipped American manufacturing overseas, hollowing out previously bustling industrial towns around America. <b>Because corporations shipped jobs overseas for a profit, there is now widespread xenophobic animosity, anti-immigrant sentiments, and protectionist instincts in our society today.</b> This is why, to this day, China is the number one producer of greenhouse gases in the world, by far. The CEOs of large corporations profited off the destruction of the dreams of entire cities, and it's time we rebuild on our own terms. <b>We can revitalize industrial America with a massive green infrastructure project, to be paid for in full by the very people who profited by shipping the jobs overseas</b> ‚Äî the wealthy, not the high earners.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now most mainstream Democratic politicians are afraid appearing racist and socialist, so they shy away from this policy. Well not me; I'm an American of Chinese descent, who is not only a <a href="taxes.html" target="_blank">capitalist</a>, but believes that we need to fight to restore the prosperity of the working class by any means necessary. And if American "socialism" can steal back the future that Chinese communism stole from us, then count me in, comrade!
            </p>
            <p>
              As we've seen with the tariffs, we can't un-globalize the economy. But we can channel that anger to rebuild our society instead of lashing out and committing economic acts of terror against our allies around the world. <b>We must be able to stand up for the large swaths of Americans who are economically disadvantaged due to recent macroeconomic trends ‚Äî the globalization of the economy ‚Äî and not just those who were historically oppressed for surface-level identitarian reasons. We can and must do both.</b> And while we can't go back in time, I believe fully in a clean-energy American future, not the Beijing smog. We can fight hard to restore the prosperity of the forgotten men and women of America, ensuring that anyone ‚Äî regardless of race, gender, creed, or class ‚Äî can achieve the American Dream.

              I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering running for office in 2026 to represent PA-3 in Congress, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer by harming our society, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and write laws to help serve the common good.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
