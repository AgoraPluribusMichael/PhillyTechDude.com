                  The world is spiraling out of control, and it's hard to watch â€” like a slow-motion train wreck. The powers that be â€” the government, the corporations, the establishment, the adversarial nations around the world â€” want everyone to feel powerless so that they remain in control.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And while we can't control what those nefarious dark forces are doing to try to control the narrative and pull the strings behind the scenes, we must reject the victim mentality, and be the change we want to see in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not any one of us can save our society alone, but together, we can be unstoppable. Together, we can rise up against the fear, uncertainty, doubt, and outrage. Together, we can defeat the suppressive learned helplessness imposed on us by the fascist corporate elites and foreign authoritarian governments trying to hold us down. Together, we can fight to save our society, powered by the optimism we have in our own capabilities and desires for a better future. Together, we can write and become the narrative that rises above the oppression to realize our capacity to become a nation of free will.

            <h2>We Can Overcome Learned Helplessness With Constructive Individual Action</h2>
            <p>
              While I'm a life-long Democrat, I fully believe that it is possible to learn something from just about anyone. And for the longest time, I never understood this video from former Navy SEAL Jocko Willink: "Good."
            </p>

              But now, that video is core to my belief on how we can best defeat authoritarianism in America. It takes each and every one of us, on an individual level, to believe in our own capabilities and rise up to save our society. We are not experts, but we are also not helpless. Once we start realizing how much agency we have in our own minds and bodies, it becomes abundantly clear that even the most fearsome authoritarian forces on Earth are nowhere near as powerful as they want you to believe. So let's channel our anger towards <a href="democracy.html#save-democracy">productive and constructive organizing</a>, not cynicism, extremism, violence, or despair.

            <h2 id="societal-pessimism">On Extremism, Conspiratorial Thinking, and Vigilantism</h2>
            <p>
              Shortly after the 2024 election, a lone wolf vigilante <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Brian_Thompson" target="_blank">murdered the CEO of a private health insurance company in broad daylight on the streets of New York City</a>, which I strongly condemn, especially when <b>there exist perfectly peaceful and legal ways to reform the health insurance industry</b>. But this points to a broader phenomenon, where if the government and proper authorities don't do their job, then there is a risk for vigilantes to come out of the woodwork and pursue their own version of so-called "justice." In this way, I view vigilantism as a policy failure. But to dig down deeper, I truly believe that this form of vigilantism fits into a larger pattern: <b>people risk being sucked into third-party political ideologies, bizarre conspiracy theories, or violence when they lose faith in society</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              People who join third parties self-select for those who have lost faith in the two major parties. And while the policies and attitudes differ greatly among them, they share a common theme: the complete loss of faith in one major aspect of our society. Anarchists have lost faith in the government, ecosocialists have lost faith in the economy, and populists have lost faith in the establishment. And while third-party policies tend to be extreme, regressive, or unrealistic, they are at least grounded in a real criticism of the system and are constructive in nature, as they attempt to enact positive change through our existing political and legal democratic process. And it helps that they can commiserate together instead of completely isolating themselves away from the rest of the mainstream public. But it is still a stinging indictment of the Democratic and Republican parties for some people to be searching outside the mainstream for <i>something</i> to fix the problem, a symptom of incompetence and negligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the pandemic, there was a huge spike in the prevalence of conspiracies. I think it has to do with this overwhelming and unbearable feeling of fear and helplessness. Everything shut down, and people were dying, and the Trump Administration so thoroughly bungled its response to the pandemic, that even some of Trump's most ardent supporters were calling it a "plandemic," as if it were entirely predictable that Trump would fail to respond competently that someone could have planned COVID-19 to sink his re-election campaign. In fact, my mental health took a dire turn at the time, and I started to go down the road of voluntaryist libertarianism and psychosis. Luckily for me, four years of a mixture of psychiatric care from <a href="democracy.html#ccmc-act" target="_blank">Crozer Psychiatry</a> and therapy across several mental health providers allowed me to make a full recovery. I hypothesize that people tend to look to conspiracy theories, because they find it more comforting to believe that <i>someone</i> is in control, that there is a network of shadowy, nefarious figures that have corrupted and taken control of the government and pull the strings behind the scenes to oppress the masses, which prevents even the most good-hearted and powerful politicians from addressing systemic injustices. For a widow grieving the loss of her husband to COVID-19, when they were supposed to retire in a few years and travel the world together, it's only human for her to be desperately searching for a <i>reason</i>, for <i>someone</i> to behind all this.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the whole, this can form a negative feedback loop, as the extreme third-party policies and bizarre conspiracy theories can be so off-putting to the general public, that it can result in chronic isolation, delusion, and despair. For some who stew for long enough in a place of isolation and unbearable desperation, they eventually feel the need to lash out through violent individual action, either directed outwardly (mass shootings, murders, acts of terror) or inwardly (addiction, self harm, suicide, deaths of despair) â€” the tragic and natural outcome of a complete loss of faith in any institution, system, or legal means to achieve justice. This is my assessment for how someone who was previously a happy and productive member of society could end up murdering a health insurance CEO on the streets of New York City.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, I view extremism, despair, cynicism, isolation, and vigilante violence as symptoms of existential societal rot, which paves the way for oppressive "strong-man" authoritarianism to fill the void where everyone else has failed. This is why I believe that <b>the widespread loss of faith in our society is the biggest policy failure of our times</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way I can think of to combat this trend is to inspire people, on an individual level, to realize their capabilities to make a positive change through peaceful and legal means. Together, we can leverage existing power structures and legal procedures to <a href="democracy.html#save-democracy">be the change we want to see</a>.

              I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering getting into public policy, advocacy, or even running for office, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and/or write laws to help serve the common good.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
