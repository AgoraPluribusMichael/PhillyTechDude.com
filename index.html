            Are you frustrated by a political system that seems stuck in gridlock, dominated by corporate lobbyists, and disconnected from the everyday needs of ordinary people?
          </p>
          <p>
            You're not alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is a blueprint for something different. It's a collection of original, practical, and fully articulated policy proposals designed by a civic-minded software engineer ‚Äî not a career politician, not a think tank operative, and definitely not a lobbyist. It's powered by research, logic, and a belief that everyday Americans can take democracy back into their own hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're a common-sense liberal, a fed-up progressive, a market-minded conservative, a politically homeless cynic, or just someone trying to make sense of the chaos and trying not to lose faith in our society, you'll find something here that speaks to you.

                This section provides solutions to allow ordinary people to use existing procedures and underutilized tools ‚Äî like the discharge petition ‚Äî to break congressional gridlock and fight to make the government work for us ‚Äî not themselves, the corporate special interests, or their donors.

              <h2>New Globalism</h2>
              <p>
                In reaction to the decades-long trend of corporations shipping jobs overseas at the expense of American prosperity, I present a novel international vision that would encourage foreign investors to invest in America again.

              <p>
                Why are the biggest corporations rewarded for destroying jobs? Let‚Äôs flip the incentives ‚Äî and use small business investment as the engine of American prosperity.

              <h2>Taxes</h2>
              <p>
                The tax system that funds the federal government is rigged against working people in favor of protecting the wealthy. I make the case for why a wealth gains tax can help us force the wealthy to pay their fair share in taxes.

              <p>
                Social Security, the flagship American pension program that has kept millions of seniors out of poverty for decades, is under financial strain. To prevent Social Security from going bankrupt, I propose novel strategies to protect and expand Social Security in a way that sidesteps congressional gridlock.

                A grab bag of miscellaneous original policy ideas ‚Äî mostly attempting to leverage the ability for Congress to authorize compacts and treaties between states to break through partisan gridlock ‚Äî all engineered by a concerned citizen who thinks outside the Beltway and outside the box.

                It's easy to lose hope when Donald Trump and the dictators around the world are creating a global atmosphere of chaos. If you're looking for a reason to believe change is possible ‚Äî start here.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering getting into public policy or advocacy after 6 years in the software engineering industry, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and write laws to help serve the common good.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
        </p>
        <p>
          All opinions and arguments that appear on this site are my own. Additionally, except where expressly denoted, all policies that appear on this site are ones that I've engineered myself, not as an expert, but as a layman and freedom-minded tech dude who came up with my own solutions and formed my own opinions through my own observations, my own research, and my own critical thought.
