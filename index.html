            Are you frustrated by a political system that seems stuck in gridlock, dominated by corporate lobbyists, and disconnected from the everyday needs of ordinary people?
          </p>
          <p>
            You're not alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is a blueprint for something different. It's a collection of original, practical, and fully articulated policy proposals designed by a civic-minded software engineer and private citizen — not a career politician, not a think tank operative, and definitely not a lobbyist. It's powered by research, logic, and a belief that everyday Americans can take democracy back into their own hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're a common-sense liberal, a fed-up progressive, a market-minded conservative, a politically homeless cynic, or just someone trying to make sense of the chaos and trying not to lose faith in our society, you'll find something here that speaks to you.

            <h2>Democracy</h2>
            <p>
              Our government too often speaks and acts on behalf of the president, the corporations, the special interest groups, and the career political insiders instead of the American people. In this section, I outline existing procedures and underutilized tools — like the discharge petition — that ordinary people could use to make the government work for us — not themselves, the corporate special interests, or their donors. Additionally, I propose a few structural changes to strengthen the checks and balances on the president's power.

            <h2>New Globalism</h2>
            <p>
              For the last several decades, large corporations have shipped jobs overseas, to the benefit of their shareholders and at the expense of American prosperity. In this section, I present a novel international vision that would reverse this trend and encourage foreign investors to invest in America again.

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <p>
              Our profit-driven corporate economy too often rewards large corporations for destroying jobs and degrading the quality and quantity of their products and services. Let's flip the incentives. In this section, I argue that we should invest in small business owners instead of large corporations so that we can restore the economy as an engine for American prosperity.

            <h2>Taxes</h2>
            <p>
              The tax system that funds the federal government is rigged against working people in favor of protecting the wealthy. In this section, I make the case for why a wealth gains tax can help us force the wealthy to pay their fair share in taxes so that the government can continue to fund invaluable programs that serve the American public.

            <h2>Social Security</h2>
            <p>
              Social Security, the flagship American pension program that has kept millions of seniors out of poverty for nearly a century, is under financial strain. In this section, I propose novel strategies to protect and expand Social Security in a way that sidesteps congressional gridlock.

              This section contains a grab bag of miscellaneous original policy ideas — mostly centered around the idea of utilizing interstate compacts between like-minded states to break through the national partisan gridlock — all engineered by a concerned citizen who thinks outside the Beltway and outside the box.

            <p>
              When chaos seems to come from every direction — from political and corporate corruption to government dysfunction and rising authoritarianism around the world — it's hard to stay hopeful. If you come from outside the political mainstream, or you're cynical but still looking for a reason to believe change is possible — start here.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer who lives in Philly. After six years of working in the private sector, I quit my day job to launch my startup company Agora Pluribus Technologies, with the goal of using my sklls to empower ordinary people, because I want to be a part of the solution, not the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.

          All opinions and arguments that appear on this site are my own. Additionally, except where expressly denoted, all policies that appear on this site are ones that I've engineered myself, not as an expert, but as a layman and freedom-minded tech dude who came up with my own solutions and formed my own opinions through my own observations, my own research, and my own critical thought.
