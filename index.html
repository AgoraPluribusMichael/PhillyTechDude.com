          <h1>It's Time to Rise Up and Reclaim our Society</h1>
          <h2>It Takes a Village to Save a Village</h2>

          <p>
            The world is spiraling out of control, and it's hard to watch — like a slow-motion train wreck. The powers that be — the government, the corporations, the establishment, the adversarial nations around the world — want everyone to feel powerless so that they remain in control. But ordinary citizens can and must be capable in a functioning democratic society, even without formal expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I'm a life-long Democrat, I fully believe that it is possible to learn something from just about anyone. And for the longest time, I never understood this video from former Navy SEAL Jocko Willink: "Good."

            But now, that video is core to my belief on how we can best defeat authoritarianism in America. It takes each and every one of us, on an individual level, to believe in our own capabilities and rise up to save our democracy and society. We are not experts, but we are also not helpless. <b>Together, we can reject the victim mentality, and be the change we want to see in the world.</b> We can't control what those nefarious dark forces are doing to try to control the narrative and pull the strings behind the scenes, but once we start realizing how much agency we have in our own minds and bodies, it becomes abundantly clear that they're nowhere near as powerful as they want you to believe. It's time to rise up against the fear, uncertainty, doubt, and outrage, and channel our anger towards productive and constructive organizing, not violence or despair. Not any one of us can save our society alone, but together, we can be unstoppable — a nation of free will.

            This site contains some of my ideas to reclaim our society. I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
