        <h1>Welcome to Philly Tech Dude Politics</h1>
        <h2>A Political Blog from a Citizen Who Cares</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Are you frustrated by a political system that seems stuck in gridlock, dominated by corporate lobbyists, and
        disconnected from the everyday needs of ordinary people?
      </p>
      <p>
        You're not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is a blueprint for something different. It's a collection of original, practical, and fully
        articulated policy proposals designed by a civic-minded software engineer and private citizen ‚Äî not a career
        politician, not a think tank operative, and definitely not a lobbyist. It's powered by <a
          href="https://leonardbernstein.com/lectures/speeches/jfk-memorial-speech" target="_blank">learning and
          reason</a>, and a belief that everyday Americans can take democracy back into their own hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideologically speaking, this is a 21st-century reimaginement of the politics of President Theodore Roosevelt,
        the Bull Moose Progressive who took on the corrupted corporate Republican Party machine in the early 1900's as a
        populist progressive capitalist Republican.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a common-sense liberal, a fed-up progressive, a market-minded conservative, a politically
        homeless cynic, or just someone trying to make sense of the chaos and trying not to lose faith in our society,
        you'll find something here that speaks to you.

          <h2>Democracy</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Our government too often speaks and acts on behalf of the president, the corporations, the special interest
          groups, and the career political insiders instead of the American people. In this section, I propose ways to
          fight radical corruption in Congress and the White House with common-sense transparency and collaboration.

          <h2>New Globalism</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          For the last several decades, large corporations have shipped jobs overseas, to the benefit of their
          shareholders and at the expense of American prosperity. In this section, I present a novel international
          vision that would reverse this trend and encourage foreign investors to invest in America again.

          <h2>Economy</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Our economy too often rewards large corporations for destroying jobs and degrading the quality and quantity of
          their products and services. Let's flip the incentives. In this section, I argue that we should invest in
          small business owners instead of large corporations and propose ways to decentralize the power in the economy
          so that we can restore the economy as an engine for American prosperity.

          <h2>Taxes</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The tax system that funds the government is rigged against working people in favor of protecting the wealthy.
          In this section, I make the case for a Required Minimum Dividend, and more broadly why forcing the wealthy to
          pay their fair share in taxes would reduce the tax drag on American workers, fund invaluable government
          programs that serve the American public, and encourage an economy of inclusive growth.

          <h2>Social Security</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Social Security, the flagship American pension program that has kept millions of seniors out of poverty for
          nearly a century, is under financial strain. In this section, I propose strategies to protect and expand
          Social Security in a way that sidesteps congressional gridlock.

          <h2>Unite the States</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The national political environment is far too contentious and toxic for it to be easy for politicians to serve
          the American people. In this section, I propose ideas for policies that would break through the national
          partisan gridlock and make politics more local and less national.

          <h2>Rise Up</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          When chaos seems to come from every direction ‚Äî from political and corporate corruption to government
          dysfunction and rising authoritarianism around the world ‚Äî it's hard to stay hopeful. If you come from outside
          the political mainstream, or you're cynical but still looking for a reason to believe change is possible ‚Äî
          start here.

        Hi! I'm Michael Yee, a software engineer, entrepreneur, music producer, and digital artist who lives in South Philly. After six years of working in the private sector, I quit my day job
        to launch my startup company Agora Pluribus Technologies, with the goal of using my sklls to empower ordinary
        people, because I want to be a part of the solution, not the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up
        waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world
        devolves into madness.
      </p>
      <p>
        All opinions and arguments that appear on this site are my own. Additionally, except where expressly denoted,
        all policies that appear on this site are ones that I've engineered myself, not as an expert, but as a layman
        and freedom-minded tech dude who came up with my own solutions and formed my own opinions through my own
        observations, my own research, and my own critical thought.
