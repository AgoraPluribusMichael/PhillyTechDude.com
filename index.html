                  The world is spiraling out of control, and it's hard to watch â€” like a slow-motion train wreck. The powers that be â€” the government, the corporations, the establishment, the adversarial nations around the world â€” want everyone to feel powerless so that they remain in control.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And while we can't control what those nefarious dark forces are doing to try to control the narrative and pull the strings behind the scenes, we must reject the victim mentality, and be the change we want to see in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not any one of us can save our society alone, but together, we can be unstoppable. Together, we can rise up against the fear, uncertainty, doubt, and outrage. Together, we can defeat the suppressive learned helplessness imposed on us by the fascist corporate elites and foreign authoritarian governments trying to hold us down. Together, we can fight to save our society, powered by the optimism we have in our own capabilities and desires for a better future. Together, we can write and become the narrative that rises above the oppression to realize our capacity to become a nation of free will.

              While I'm a life-long Democrat, I fully believe that it is possible to learn something from just about anyone. And for the longest time, I never understood this video from former Navy SEAL Jocko Willink: "Good."

              But now, that video is core to my belief on how we can best defeat authoritarianism in America. It takes each and every one of us, on an individual level, to believe in our own capabilities and rise up to save our society. We are not experts, but we are also not helpless. Once we start realizing how much agency we have in our own minds and bodies, it becomes abundantly clear that even the most fearsome authoritarian forces on Earth are nowhere near as powerful as they want you to believe. So let's channel our anger towards <a href="democracy.html#save-democracy">productive and constructive organizing</a>, not <a href="policies.html#societal-pessimism">extremism, violence, cynicism, or despair</a>.

              I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering running for office in 2026 to represent PA-3 in Congress, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer by harming our society, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and write laws to help serve the common good.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
