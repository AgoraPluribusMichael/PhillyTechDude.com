          <h1>It Takes a Village to Save a Village</h1>

          <p>
            The world is spiraling out of control, and it's hard to watch -- like a slow-motion train wreck. The powers that be -- the government, the corporations, the establishment, the adversarial nations around the world -- want everyone to feel powerless so that they remain in control. But ordinary citizens can and must be capable in a functioning democratic society, even without formal expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some of my ideas to reclaim our society. I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world is devolving into madness.

            It takes each and every one of us, on an individual level, to believe in our own capabilities and rise up to save our democracy and society. We are not helpless. It's time to get off the sidelines and save our democracy now!
