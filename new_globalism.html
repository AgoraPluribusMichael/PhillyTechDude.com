          <h1>Let's Right the Wrongs of Globalism with New Globalism</h1>
          <h2>We Can Onshore Jobs and Globalize Investments into an American Future</h2>
          <p>
            Over the past several decades, large, multinational corporations have shipped American manufacturing overseas, hollowing out previously bustling industrial towns around America. <b>It's because the corporations shipped jobs overseas for a profit that there is now widespread xenophobic animosity, anti-immigrant sentiments, and protectionist instincts in our society today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the decades since, the backlash has taken shape in the form of Trumpist populism. And let's be honest â€” <b>it's okay to be angry</b>. It's okay to grieve the loss of good-paying jobs, thriving communities, and the dignity that came with them. Much of that pain was caused by corporations chasing cheap labor in countries like China, which is, to this day, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, by far.
          </p>
          <p>
            For all the ways the Democratic Party has changed over the years, the <b>Clinton-era Democrats</b> have maintained such a strong influence, that no mainstream Democrat has been willing to <b>publicly reject the free trade policies that promised a new era of economic prosperity, but instead accelerated the globalist economic devastation of the Industrial Midwest</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the hard truth: <b>we can't un-globalize the economy</b>. We can't go back in time. Tariffs and trade wars haven't worked â€” they've only caused further damage by creating huge distortions in the economy and angering our allies around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if we could <b>use globalization to our benefit â€” instead of to our detriment</b>?

          <h2 class="section-header" id="societal-bond-fund">The American Societal Bond Fund</h2>
          <p>
            Introducing the <b>American Societal Bond Fund</b> â€” a bold new policy that transforms public investment into a global opportunity. The U.S. government already issues countless loans to serve the public good: small business loans, student loans, infrastructure financing, farm loans, and more. So the proposal is to aggregate the loans into a new kind of <b>high-yield bond fund â€” one that anyone in the world can invest in</b>. 
          <p>
            It is noteworthy to state that <b>this is not public ownership of small businesses</b> â€” bonds are loans, not stocks; they don't confer ownership, control, or voting rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investors around the world already invest in U.S. Treasury and municipal bonds. So this would be just another American bond fund, but with a twist â€” <b>the bonds cannot be sold directly</b>. The brokerages would keep track of the cost basis of the investment, and over a period of time, the principal of the investment would be liquidated back into the investor's settlement fund, plus interest. We could have short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term options. In this way, it's a <b>high-yield bond fund that acts like a loan</b>, so as to preserve our economic resilience and ensure long-term, stable funding for the American people. It's more than just an investment that <b>boasts an interest rate higher than the best CDs on the market</b>. It's a vote of confidence â€” a way to finally put global capital to work rebuilding American prosperity, all while <b>improving the U.S. government's declining credit rating</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The American Societal Bond Fund is a comprehensive civic investment vehicle, with <b>equal parts Obama-Biden Bond Fund and Trump Bond Fund</b> â€” a bipartisan blend of high-yield public-interest bonds that support everything from climate infrastructure to domestic manufacturing.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the whole, this diversified societal bond fund forms a unified platform for investors â€” domestic or global â€” to contribute to the public good, earn stable returns, and strengthen the American economy from both ends of the political spectrum.

          <h3>Together, We Can Restore the Industrial Midwest to its Former Glory</h3>
          <p>
            It's no coincidence that China is the number one producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, by far. It's because the CEOs of large corporations profited off the destruction of the dreams of entire cities in the Industrial Midwest by shipping manufacturing to China. It's time we rebuild on our own terms. <b>We can revitalize industrial America with a massive green infrastructure project, to be paid for in full by the very corporations that profited by shipping the jobs overseas</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now most mainstream Democratic politicians are afraid appearing racist and socialist, so they shy away from this policy. Well not me; I'm an American of Chinese descent, who is not only a <a href="taxes.html" target="_blank">capitalist</a>, but believes that we need to fight to restore the prosperity of the working class by any means necessary. And if American "socialism" can steal back the future that Chinese communism stole from us, then count me in, comrade!
          </p>
          <p>
            As we've seen with the tariffs, we can't un-globalize the economy. But we can channel that anger to rebuild our society instead of lashing out and committing economic acts of terror against our allies around the world. <b>We must stand up for the large swaths of Americans who are economically disadvantaged due to recent macroeconomic trends</b> â€” the globalization of the economy â€” <b>in addition to those who were historically oppressed for surface-level identitarian reasons</b>. We can and must do both.
          </p>
          <p>
            And while we can't go back in time, I believe fully in a clean-energy American future, not the Beijing smog. Let's fight hard to restore the prosperity of the forgotten men and women of America, ensuring that anyone â€” regardless of race, gender, creed, or class â€” can achieve the American Dream.

          <p>
            I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering getting into public policy, advocacy, or even running for office, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and write laws to help serve the common good.
          </p>
          <p>
            I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
