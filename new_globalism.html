            <h1>Let's Right the Wrongs of the Past with New Globalism</h1>
            <h2>We Can Onshore Jobs and Globalize Investments into an American Future</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Over the past several decades, large, multinational corporations have shipped American manufacturing overseas, hollowing out previously bustling industrial towns around the country. <b>This trend of outsourcing labor is the main reason why xenophobic animosity, anti-immigrant sentiments, and protectionist instincts are commonplace in our society today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the decades since, the backlash has taken shape in the form of Trumpist populism. And let's be honest ‚Äî <b>it's okay to be angry</b>. It's okay to grieve the loss of good-paying jobs, thriving communities, and the dignity that came with them. Much of that pain was caused by corporate C-suite executives chasing cheap labor in countries like China, which is, to this day, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, by far.
          </p>
          <p>
            For all the ways the Democratic Party has changed over the years, the <b>Clinton-era Democrats</b> have maintained such a strong influence, that no mainstream Democrat has been willing to <b>publicly reject the free trade policies that promised a new era of economic prosperity, but instead accelerated the corporate, globalist economic devastation of the Industrial Midwest</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't always like this. In the 1960's, the Democratic Party cared about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" target="_blank">learning and
            reason of the people</a>. But nowadays, they care much more about the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton" target="_blank">qualifications and expertise of
            themselves</a>. Put more bluntly, <b>this isn't your grandmother's Democratic Party</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the hard truth: <b>we can't un-globalize the economy</b>. We can't go back in time. <b>Tariffs and trade wars haven't worked</b> ‚Äî they've only caused further damage by creating huge distortions in the economy and angering our allies around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if we could <b>use globalization to our benefit ‚Äî instead of to our detriment</b>?

          </header>
          <p>
            Introducing the <b>Great Societal Bond Fund</b> ‚Äî a bold new policy that transforms public investment into a global opportunity. The U.S. government already issues countless loans to serve the public good: small business loans, student loans, infrastructure financing, farm loans, and more. So the proposal is to aggregate the loans into a new kind of <b>high-yield bond fund ‚Äî one that anyone in the world can invest in</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investors around the world already trade U.S. Treasury and municipal bonds. So this would be just another American bond fund, but with a twist ‚Äî <b>the bonds cannot be sold directly</b>. The brokerages would keep track of the cost basis of the investments, and over a period of time, the principal of the investments would be liquidated back into the investor's settlement fund, plus interest. We could have short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term options. In this way, it's a <b>high-yield bond fund that acts like a loan</b>, so as to preserve our economic resilience and ensure long-term, stable funding for the American people. It's more than just an investment that <b>boasts an interest rate higher than the best CDs on the market</b>. It's a vote of confidence ‚Äî a way to finally put global capital to work rebuilding American prosperity, all while <b>improving the U.S. government's declining credit rating</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Great Societal Bond Fund is a comprehensive civic investment vehicle, with <b>equal parts Obama-Biden Bond Fund and Trump Bond Fund</b> ‚Äî a bipartisan blend of high-yield public-interest bonds that support everything from climate infrastructure to domestic manufacturing.
          </p>
          <p>
            These bond funds are named after U.S. presidents not for partisan branding, but because presidents are among the most recognized political figures in the world. <b>Leveraging their name recognition, legacy, and symbolic power makes these funds more attractive to both domestic and international investors</b>. Just as Treasury bonds carry the full faith and credit of the United States, these public-interest bond funds carry the identity of American leadership ‚Äî helping position them as credible, patriotic, and high-impact investment vehicles on the global stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the whole, this diversified societal bond fund forms a unified platform for investors ‚Äî domestic or global ‚Äî to contribute to the public good, earn stable returns, and strengthen the American economy from both ends of the political spectrum.

            <h3>Together, We Can Restore the Industrial Midwest to its Former Glory</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            It's no coincidence that China is the number one producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, by far. It's because the CEOs of large corporations profited off the destruction of the dreams of entire cities in the Industrial Midwest by shipping manufacturing to China. (The jobs could have been shipped anywhere in the world, but China happened to have the cheapest labor at the time.) It's time we rebuild on our own terms. <b>We can revitalize industrial America with a massive green infrastructure project, to be paid for in full by the very corporations that outsourced the labor</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now most liberals are afraid appearing racist and socialist, so they shy away from this policy. Well not me; I'm an American of Chinese descent, who is not only a <a href="taxes.html" target="_blank">capitalist</a>, but believes that we need to fight to restore the prosperity of the working class by any means necessary. <b>This policy would honor the legacy of President Theodore Roosevelt, the Bull Moose Progressive Republican who took on the corrupted corporate Republican Party machine and fought for a Square Deal in the early 1900's</b> -- that is, a deal that is fair and square for the people, not the corporate monopolies. The Green Square Deal would be based more on the Marshall Plan for the Midwest than the Green New Deal or Build Back Better Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we've seen with the tariffs, we can't un-globalize the economy. But we can channel that anger to rebuild our society instead of lashing out and committing economic acts of terror against our allies around the world. <b>We must stand up for the large swaths of Americans who are economically disadvantaged due to recent macroeconomic trends</b> ‚Äî the globalization of the economy ‚Äî <b>in addition to those who were historically oppressed for surface-level identitarian reasons</b>. We can and must do both.
          </p>
          <p>
            And while we can't go back in time, I believe fully in a clean-energy American future, not the Beijing smog. Let's fight hard to restore the prosperity of the forgotten men and women of America, ensuring that anyone ‚Äî regardless of race, gender, creed, or class ‚Äî can achieve the American Dream.
