          <h1>A Capitalist Case for the Wealth Tax</h1>
          <p>
            The economy is a vast, intricate network of millions of individuals that buy and sell goods and services from each other. Think of a giant web of millions of circles, connected organically by lines of volition. Each transaction is a mutually-agreed-upon exchange of value. For example, I can trade $6 for a carton of eggs. Most people see money as inherently valuable, but I see it as a resource. Before I spend the $6, it could be used to buy anything, whether that be a carton of eggs, 24 gumballs, a jpeg of a monkey with a beanie hat, etc. But that value is only <b><u>realized</u></b> when the money is spent.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a vast majority of people, this isn't a problem, because we all have a plan to use the money to improve our lives -- for school, a new car, rent, a house, a wedding, raising a family, that next vacation, and retirement -- basically, to live the American Dream. But there are some extraordinarily wealthy people who are sitting on millions and millions of dollars of wealth, with no plans to use it. And I don't think it's out of greed or malice; it's simply the case that past some certain point, there's no longer anything to buy. It's not even "the economy of the 99% vs. the economy of the 1%." A vast amount of the wealth in the top 1% has no realistic expectation of ever being used for anything, so it is by definition <b>not</b> in the economy. If it's being hoarded, it can't be used to sell or buy anything. 
          </p>

            In a healthy economy, the money moves around. Yes, we all own money, but there is a social contract to it, too. Make sure you have a plan to <b>realize the value</b> of that money. I'm not about to collect my paycheck at work, then dig a hole in the ground and bury it under 6 feet of dirt and leave it there for 100 years.

            Currently, a vast majority of the revenue flowing into the federal government comes from income taxes, which is then used to promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense of the United States (A1Â§8). And while serving the common good is valuable (it's almost the sole mission of the US federal government as per the preamble to the Constitution), the current system takes away funds that would otherwise be used in the economy to improve workers' individual lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me, the solution is obvious (although it took years of parsing through political bullshit to arrive here lol). By shifting the burden of tax from the workers to the wealthy, we can increase take-home pay <i>and</i> allow the federal government to serve the common good of the people of the United States. A wealth tax doubly serves as an incentive ðŸ”° for the wealthy to use their wealth in the economy, and more broadly punishes economic stagnation while rewarding productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe it used to be the case that high wealth strongly correlated to high income. But these days, there are trillions of dollars of wealth that are simply being hoarded, while even the highest earners in America would need to work for thousands of years straight to even catch up. It should easily be possible to fund the government entirely from excessive wealth from the top 1%, which would create a tax system that lauds and rewards people for making it big. Being in the 99th percentile of net worth in America is a remarkable, exceptional achievement. Imagine a government funded in full off the excess of the overwhelming successes of our wealthiest citizens.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary: <b>Hands off the working class; we'll tax the rich, and they'll like it!</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: 1% wealth tax to be applied on the annual increase in net worth of those in the 99th percentile for net worth.

          <p>
            For individuals with a net worth exceeding the 99th percentile, annual changes in net worth shall be treated as realized income under the Haig-Simons definition of income â€” a framework consistent with the 16th Amendment and thus not subject to the apportionment requirement for direct taxes under Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution. The extraordinarily wealthy want finance to feel complicated and inaccessible to ordinary people. But at the end of the day, it's just money moving around. We already track ordinary workers' incomes through W-4's for purposes of collecting income taxes. So any attempt for the 99th percentile to move their money around in a way to avoid a wealth tax must have a clear paper trail â€” and if it doesn't, it starts looking less like tax avoidance and more like institutionalized money laundering.
