            <h3>Let's Fight Wealth Hoarding With Trickle-Down Economics</h3>
            <p>
              The economy is a vast, intricate network of millions of individuals that buy and sell goods and services from each other. Think of a giant web of millions of circles, connected organically by lines of volition. Each transaction is a mutually-agreed-upon exchange of value. For example, I can trade $6 for a carton of eggs. Most people see money as inherently valuable, but I see it as a resource. Before I spend the $6, it could be used to buy anything, whether that be a carton of eggs, 24 gumballs, a jpeg of a monkey with a beanie hat, etc. But that value is only <b><u>realized</u></b> when the money is spent.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a vast majority of people, this isn't a problem, because we all have a plan to use the money to improve our lives ‚Äî for groceries, gas, entertainment, school, a car payment, insurance, rent, a house, a wedding, raising a family, that next vacation, retirement ‚Äî basically, to finance the American Dream and afford the cost of living and discretionary luxuries. But there are some extraordinarily wealthy people who are sitting on millions and millions of dollars of wealth, with no plans to use it. And I don't think it's out of greed or malice; it's simply the case that past some certain point, there's no longer anything to buy. It's not even "the economy of the 99% vs. the economy of the 1%." A vast amount of the wealth in the top 1% has no realistic expectation of ever being used for anything, so it is by definition <b>not</b> in the economy. If it's being hoarded, it can't be used to sell or buy anything. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In a healthy economy, the money moves around. Yes, we all own money, but there is a social contract to it, too. Make sure you have a plan to <b>realize the value</b> of that money. I'm not about to collect my paycheck at work, then dig a hole in the ground and bury it under 6 feet of dirt and leave it there for 100 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, a vast majority of the revenue flowing into the federal government comes from income taxes, which is then used to promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense of the United States (<a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#1-8:~:text=The%20Congress%20shall%20have%20Power%20To%20lay%20and%20collect%20Taxes%2C%20Duties%2C%20Imposts%20and%20Excises%2C%20to%20pay%20the%20Debts%20and%20provide%20for%20the%20common%20Defence%20and%20general%20Welfare%20of%20the%20United%20States" target="_blank">Article I, Section 8</a>). And while serving the common good is practically the sole mission of the US federal government (<a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#1-8:~:text=We%20the%20People,States%20of%20America." target="_blank">Preamble to the Constitution</a>), the current system takes away funds that would otherwise be used in the economy to improve workers" individual lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              To me, the solution is obvious. By shifting the burden of tax from the workers to the wealthy, we can increase take-home pay <i>and</i> allow the federal government to serve the common good of the people of the United States. Why tax workers up front, when we can instead wait for some of them to become multi-millionaires or billionaires, and then tax them then? A wealth tax doubly serves as an incentive for the wealthy to use their wealth in the economy, and more broadly punishes economic stagnation while rewarding productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe it used to be the case that high wealth meant to high income. But these days, there are trillions of dollars of wealth that are simply being hoarded, while even the highest earners in America would need to work for centuries to catch up. It should easily be possible to fund the government entirely from excessive wealth from the wealthiest among us, which would create a tax system that lauds and rewards people for making it big. Achieving an astronomical net worth in America is a remarkable, exceptional achievement. Imagine a government funded in full off the excess of the overwhelming successes of our wealthiest citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary: <b>Hands off the working class; we'll tax the rich, and they'll like it!</b>

            </p>
            <p>
              As an engineer, and not a lawyer, I cannot, for the life of me, understand why people collecting their direct deposits on pay day can easily be subject to an income tax on realized income, and the total value of Harlan Crow's properties and land can be taxed indirectly through a split-rate tax, and yet Elon Musk's net worth cannot be taxed in any way other than a direct wealth tax. It's almost as if the tax code was designed to be rigged against ordinary people to protect the ill-gotten gains of the CEOs who ship jobs overseas for profit. Why is it so easy to tax workers' income but so difficult to tax wealth? If it were completely up to me, I would allow indirect taxes to be applied against the total net worth of the top 1% via wealth taxes, because I view unrealized wealth as a resource with a social contract and see no meaningful distinction between net worth, property value, and land value.
            </p>
            <p>
              And while a constitutional wealth tax would be the holy grail of just and equitable tax law, I think there's a much stronger, more viable statutory argument to be made for the wealth <b>gains</b> tax. So for the time being, I think it makes the most sense to pursue that.
            </p>
            <p>

              We should let economists define what income is, not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_v._Macomber" target="_blank">financially illiterate 5-4 court majority from over 100 years ago</a>. If we simply decide to listen to the experts and statutorialy define wealth gains as income, we can fight decades of wage stagnation to fund real tax relief for millions of working people by hiking taxes on the unrealized wealth of the top 1%. And we can do such a tax maneuver with only a simple majority in the Senate.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event that the wealth gains tax gets passed into law, this would place the onus on the Supreme Court if they wanted to make a ruling that would so obviously undermine the general welfare of the United States by revoking newfound economic freedom for millions of families to protect the unrealized wealth of a few billionaires.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is far past time that we overturn Eisner v. Macomber, not only so we can infuse an extraordinary amount of unrealized value into the lives of millions of Americans, but also so that we can completely defuse, on a legal and structural level, the most long-standing point of contention in modern politics ‚Äî the false choice between the general welfare/common defense of the United States and the individual economic freedom of workers. ¬øPor qu√© no los dos? We can fund programs that serve the common good of the United States <b>and</b> reduce income taxes for millions of workers, if we could only decide to ‚Äî yes ‚Äî <b>tax the rich</b>.

            <h3>If You Can't Do the Time, Then Don't Do the Crime</h3>
            <p>
              The extraordinarily wealthy want finance to feel complicated and inaccessible to ordinary people. But at the end of the day, it's just money moving around. We already track ordinary workers" incomes through W-4's for purposes of collecting income taxes. So any attempt for the wealthy to move their money around to avoid a wealth tax must have a clear paper trail ‚Äî and if it doesn't, it starts looking less like tax avoidance and more like institutionalized money laundering.
            </p>
            <p>
              The go-to solution for cracking down on tax cheats seems to be increasing funding to the IRS. But instead of attempting to start a multi-billion-dollar arms race between the billionaires and the IRS, it would be far easier, cheaper, and effective to find a Senate parliamentarian that would allow for the imposition of a 6-month prison sentence for those who avoid the wealth gains tax, as that would not only be copacetic with the purpose of a budget resolution, but also directly increase revenues by reducing tax evasion. We should surely allow a bill that imposes new taxes to include mechanisms that can enforce the tax. Furthermore, there is no good reason why it is perfectly legal to enforce taxes by throwing billions of dollars at the IRS, but improper to enforce taxes by imposing a minimal prison penalty. Of course, in the case that this is adequately popular, we may be able to avoid the Byrd Rule procedural nonsense entirely and send this through regular order.

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="ubi">The Prosperity Dividend</h2>
            <h3>A Quarterly Robin-Hood-Powered Stimulus</h3>
            <p>
              The specific policy I'm envisioning is as follows: Every quarter, we reset the wealth basis of an individual's net worth. If the net worth increases over the quarter, the appreciation would be taxed at the wealth gains tax rate. If the net worth decreases, there would be no tax applied and no tax write-offs for realizing a wealth loss. We would use <b>W-47 forms</b> to manage compliance with the tax (Why 47? Ask Mitt Romney üôÇ).
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, this means that the taxes will only be levied if the rich get richer. So for the cynics who think they'll just avoid the tax, I'll say this: What if the easiest way for the wealth of the top 1% to decrease is for <b>the wealth to actually trickle down</b>? And if it doesn't trickle down, then we can use this wealth gains tax to force it to. The only way this tax would fail to produce tax revenue in the long run would be for a vast majority of all wealthy Americans to fail to get richer or break the law. And rich people are <i>really good</i> at getting richer, even in the wake of a once-in-a-century pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              It would be beneficial to tie the wealth gains tax rate to the Consumer Price Index to combat price gouging. I was thinking we set it to either 15% or 5 times the quarterly annualized CPI, whichever one is larger. In other words, I would propose a minimum wealth gains tax of 15% on the top 1%, but have the rate increase in the case that the quarterly annualized CPI exceeds 3%.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, with wealth being more volatile than W-4 income, it would make sense to distribute stimulus checks to the bottom 99% on a quarterly basis instead of enacting an income tax cut or tax credit. In this way, we can treat the wealth of the top 1% as a shared national endowment, where the bottom 99% can reinvest the dividends into their own lives. Surely, something that is so clearly beneficial to the economy can only be construed as capitalist inclusive growth, not socialism.
