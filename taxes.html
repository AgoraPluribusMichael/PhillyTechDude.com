          overwhelming successes of our wealthiest citizens, a society where the exceptional achievements of a few can
          significantly and routinely raise the standard of living for everyone across the board. This is what
          economists call <b>inclusive growth</b>. And we can achieve this with a slight — but significant — tweak to
          the tax code.

          <h3>Let's Fight Wealth Hoarding With Trickle-Down Economics</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The economy is a vast, intricate network of millions of individuals that buy and sell goods and services from
          each other. Think of a giant web of circles, connected organically by lines of volition. Each transaction is a
          mutually-agreed-upon exchange of value. For example, I can trade $6 for a carton of eggs. Most people see
          money as inherently valuable, but I believe that <b>money is a resource</b>. Before I spend the $6, it could
          be used to buy anything, whether that be a carton of eggs, 24 gumballs, or a jpeg of a monkey with a beanie
          hat. But the <b>money only becomes tangibly valuable when it is realized to buy something that is
            valuable.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          For a vast majority of people, this is a distinction without a difference, because we all have a plan to use
          the money to improve our lives — for groceries, gas, entertainment, school, a car payment, insurance, rent, a
          house, a wedding, raising a family, that next vacation, retirement — basically, to finance the American Dream
          while being able to afford the cost of living and discretionary luxuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some extraordinarily wealthy people sit on vast fortunes with no plans to use them. It's not greed or
          malice — past a certain point, there's simply nothing left to buy. <b>The biggest lie they teach you in
            economics class is
            this concept of "infinite demand."</b> If billionaires really did have infinite demand, then I assure you
          they wouldn't be billionaires anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it's not even "the economy of the 99% vs. the economy of the 1%." A vast amount of the wealth in the top
          1% has no realistic expectation of ever being used for anything, so it is, by definition, not in the economy.
          <b>Hoarded wealth can't be used in the economy to improve the lives of millions of Americans.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          In a healthy economy, the money moves around. <b>Yes, we all own money, but there is a social contract to it,
            too: Make sure you have a plan to realize the value of that money</b>. I'm not about to collect my paycheck
          at work, then dig a hole in the ground and bury it under 6 feet of dirt and leave it there for 100 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office, <a
            href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-kinds-of-revenue-does-the-government-collect/"
            target="_blank">84% of all federal tax revenue for fiscal year 2024 came from income and payroll taxes</a>.
          In my mind, it's not the amount of money flowing into the government that's the problem, as the taxes are
          primarily used to promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense of the United States (<a
            href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#1-8:~:text=The%20Congress%20shall%20have%20Power%20To%20lay%20and%20collect%20Taxes%2C%20Duties%2C%20Imposts%20and%20Excises%2C%20to%20pay%20the%20Debts%20and%20provide%20for%20the%20common%20Defence%20and%20general%20Welfare%20of%20the%20United%20States"
            target="_blank">Article I, Section 8</a>), which is practically the sole mission of the U.S. federal
          government (<a
            href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#1-8:~:text=We%20the%20People,States%20of%20America."
            target="_blank">Preamble to the Constitution</a>). The problem arises from the fact that income and payroll
          taxes take away funds that would otherwise be used in the economy to improve workers' individual lives.
          <b>Under the current tax system, serving the common good of the United States requires a tax on workers.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>But this is a false choice.</b> While this has been the case for over a century, it does not have to be
          that way any longer. <b>By
            shifting the burden of tax from the workers to the wealthy, we can increase take-home pay for workers
            <u>and</u> fund federal programs to serve the people of the United States.</b> Why do we tax workers up
          front, when we could instead wait for some of them to become multi-millionaires or billionaires, and tax them
          then? A wealth tax doubly serves as an incentive for the rich to use their wealth in the economy, and more
          broadly punishes economic stagnation while rewarding productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe it used to be the case that high wealth meant high income. But these days, there are trillions of
          dollars of wealth that are simply being hoarded, while even the highest earners in America would need to work
          for centuries to catch up. <b>It should easily be possible to fund the government entirely from excessive
            wealth from the richest among us</b>, which would create a tax system that lauds and rewards people for
          making it big instead of penalizing productivity. Achieving an astronomical net worth in America is a
          remarkable, exceptional achievement. And it's worth noting that <b>if we were to implement a wealth tax, then
            the existence of billionaires could not be construed as a policy failure</b>. To the contrary, we would
          benefit from billionaires who generate an outsized proportion of the wealth tax revenue. (Please read my
          thoughts on <a href="rise_up.html#societal-pessimism" target="_blank">what I believe to be the real policy
            failure</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary: <b>Hands off the working class; we'll tax the rich, and they'll like it!</b>

          <h3>According to Economists and the Constitution, not the Supreme Court</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          As an engineer, and not a lawyer, I cannot, for the life of me, understand why people collecting their direct
          deposits on pay day can easily be subject to a federal income tax on realized income, and the total value of
          Harlan Crow's properties and land can be taxed indirectly through a municipal split-rate tax, and yet Elon
          Musk's net worth cannot be taxed in any way other than a direct wealth tax, which is made completely unviable
          due to the apportionment requirement in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, a requirement that wasn't
          even a good idea in a 1780's agrarian society. It's almost by design that <b>the tax code is rigged against
            ordinary people to protect the ill-gotten gains of the CEOs who ship jobs overseas for profit</b>. Why is it
          so easy to tax income from poor workers, but not income from multi-billion-dollar stock portfolios?
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, while a constitutional wealth tax would be the holy grail of just and equitable tax law, it would
          probably be easier to make a <b>strong, viable statutory argument that a wealth <u>gains</u> tax is
            constitutional.</b>

            target="_blank">Article I, Section 9</a> of the Constitution.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should let the economists of today define what income is, not a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_v._Macomber" target="_blank">financially illiterate 5-4 Supreme
            Court majority from over 100 years ago</a>. <b>In the Eisner v. Macomber decision, the Supreme Court made a
            ruling that directly contradicted the 16th Amendment</b> by deciding that not all income is taxable. It was
          a blatant and flagrant <b>authoritarian overreach of judicial power</b> that invalidated the 16th Amendment
          with just 5 unelected votes, instead of the overwhelming supermajority of elected officials nationwide that
          would have been required to pass a new constitutional amendment. Furthermore, <b>the Eisner v. Macomber ruling
            undermines the original intent of the 16th Amendment</b>, which was to make it easier for the government to
          promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense — the very spirit of the Constitution itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is far past time that we <b>tax the rich</b>, not only <b>so that we can infuse an
            extraordinary amount of unrealized value into the lives of millions of Americans</b>, but also <b>so that we
            can completely and permanently defuse, on a legal and structural level, the most notorious and long-standing
            point of contention in modern politics</b> — the false choice between the common good of the United States
          and the individual economic freedom of workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come on! We live in the 21st Century! ¿Por qué no los dos? We can easily fund programs that serve the people
          of the United States <i>while</i> reducing income taxes for millions of workers; <b>we really could have it
            all if we would just allow ourselves to — yes — tax the rich!</b>

          <h3>Capital Gains Taxes are Unavoidable</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          It is true that wealth gains taxes can only generate revenue if the rich get richer. If the wealth gains tax
          were to be applied against the total wealth of individuals, there would be the same problems with
          implementation as the wealth taxes that several European countries attempted, where it leads to <a
            href="https://www.cato.org/tax-budget-bulletin/taxing-wealth-capital-income" target="_blank">large-scale
            capital flight</a> outside the taxable jurisdiction, which would result in a huge retraction in the economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, my argument for the wealth gains tax would still apply to an <b>unrealized capital gains tax</b>,
          similar to President Biden's proposed <a
            href="https://cohen.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/cohen-evo.house.gov/files/BMIT%20One%20Pager.pdf"
            target="_blank">Billionaire Minimum Income Tax</a>. <b>Capital gains taxes are already easily administered
            by all brokerages and very difficult to avoid</b>. For one, the exit tax prevents billionaires from
          renouncing their American citizenship to avoid the tax. Additionally, it would be very difficult to move
          stocks around without selling them, which in and of itself is a taxable event.

            Credit</h2>
          <h3>A Step Towards Tax Justice — For Everyone, Not Just the Wealthy</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The specific policy I'm envisioning is as follows: <b>we tax the rich, and the tax revenue gets distributed to
            tax payers in the form of a tax credit and to all childrens' Trump Accounts</b>. Yes, this is exactly
          what it sounds like: a plan to force the wealthy to pay their fair share in taxes and save Social Security.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mechanism I’m proposing to tax the gains of the ultra-wealthy is a <b>Required Minimum Dividend (RMD)
            applied to large-cap U.S. corporations</b>. The RMD would be taxed as ordinary income to shareholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on <a
            href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/table/#quarter:142;series:Corporate%20equities%20and%20mutual%20fund%20shares;demographic:networth;population:all;units:levels"
            target="_blank">quarterly data on the household wealth distribution from the Federal Reserve</a>, <b>the top
            1% own about half the market cap in the U.S. economy</b>. Thus, it is possible to apply the RMD to only the
          top 1% and still generate a lot of tax revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tax revenue generated from the RMD would be distributed evenly among the approximately 170 million tax
          returns filed every year. This would be called the <b>Robin Hood Tax Credit</b>. The end effect of this policy
          is that <b>the people who actually run the economy would pay less in taxes, and the billionaire wealth
            hoarders who skate by at the top paying next to nothing in taxes would start to pay their fair share</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I coded a quick simulation in Python using current U.S. stock market data and found that if we implement a Required Minimum Dividend (RMD) at a 5% yield on all U.S. corporations worth at least $100 billion, <b>this policy would generate over $2,300 per year per person — distributed as tax relief to all taxpayers and as annual deposits into every child's Trump Account</b>.

        Philly. After six years of working in the private sector, I quit my day job
        to launch my startup company Agora Pluribus Technologies, with the goal of using my sklls to empower ordinary
