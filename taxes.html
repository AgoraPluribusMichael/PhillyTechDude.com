            <h3>Georgist Trickle-Down Economics</h3>
            <p>
              The economy is a vast, intricate network of millions of individuals that buy and sell goods and services from each other. Think of a giant web of millions of circles, connected organically by lines of volition. Each transaction is a mutually-agreed-upon exchange of value. For example, I can trade $6 for a carton of eggs. Most people see money as inherently valuable, but I see it as a resource. Before I spend the $6, it could be used to buy anything, whether that be a carton of eggs, 24 gumballs, a jpeg of a monkey with a beanie hat, etc. But that value is only <b><u>realized</u></b> when the money is spent.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a vast majority of people, this isn't a problem, because we all have a plan to use the money to improve our lives -- for school, a new car, rent, a house, a wedding, raising a family, that next vacation, and retirement -- basically, to finance the American Dream and afford the cost of living and discretionary luxuries. But there are some extraordinarily wealthy people who are sitting on millions and millions of dollars of wealth, with no plans to use it. And I don't think it's out of greed or malice; it's simply the case that past some certain point, there's no longer anything to buy. It's not even "the economy of the 99% vs. the economy of the 1%." A vast amount of the wealth in the top 1% has no realistic expectation of ever being used for anything, so it is by definition <b>not</b> in the economy. If it's being hoarded, it can't be used to sell or buy anything. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In a healthy economy, the money moves around. Yes, we all own money, but there is a social contract to it, too. Make sure you have a plan to <b>realize the value</b> of that money. I'm not about to collect my paycheck at work, then dig a hole in the ground and bury it under 6 feet of dirt and leave it there for 100 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, a vast majority of the revenue flowing into the federal government comes from income taxes, which is then used to promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense of the United States (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8:~:text=The%20Congress%20shall%20have%20power%20to%20lay%20and%20collect%20taxes%2C%20duties%2C%20imposts%20and%20excises%2C%20to%20pay%20the%20debts%20and%20provide%20for%20the%20common%20defense%20and%20general%20welfare%20of%20the%20United%20States" target="_blank">Article I, Section 8</a>). And while serving the common good is practically the sole mission of the US federal government (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/preamble" target="_blank">Preamble to the Constitution</a>), the current system takes away funds that would otherwise be used in the economy to improve workers' individual lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              To me, the solution is obvious. By shifting the burden of tax from the workers to the wealthy, we can increase take-home pay <i>and</i> allow the federal government to serve the common good of the people of the United States. Why tax workers up front, when we can instead wait for some of them to become multi-millionaires or billionaires, and then tax them then? A wealth tax doubly serves as an incentive ðŸ”° for the wealthy to use their wealth in the economy, and more broadly punishes economic stagnation while rewarding productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe it used to be the case that high wealth meant to high income. But these days, there are trillions of dollars of wealth that are simply being hoarded, while even the highest earners in America would need to work for centuries to catch up. It should easily be possible to fund the government entirely from excessive wealth from the wealthiest among us, which would create a tax system that lauds and rewards people for making it big. Achieving an astronomical net worth in America is a remarkable, exceptional achievement. Imagine a government funded in full off the excess of the overwhelming successes of our wealthiest citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary: <b>Hands off the working class; we'll tax the rich, and they'll like it!</b>

            <h3>An Increase in Net Worth is Income -- According to Economists, not the Supreme Court</h3>

            </p>
            <p>
              For individuals with a high net worth, quarterly changes in net worth shall be treated as realized income under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haig%E2%80%93Simons_income" target="_blank">Haig-Simons definition of income</a> â€” a framework consistent with the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxvi" target="_blank">16th Amendment</a> and thus not subject to the apportionment requirement for direct taxes under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section9:~:text=Representatives%20and%20direct%20taxes%20shall%20be%20apportioned%20among%20the%20several%20states%20which%20may%20be%20included%20within%20this%20union" target="_blank">Article I, Section 9</a> of the U.S. Constitution. We should let economists define what income is, not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_v._Macomber" target="_blank">financially illiterate 5-4 court majority from over 100 years ago</a>. If we simply decide to listen to the experts and legally define wealth gains as income, we can fight decades of wage stagnation to fund real tax relief for millions of working people by hiking taxes on the gluttonous unrealized wealth of the fascist corporate elites who are destroying our society for profit. And we can do such a tax maneuver with only a simple majority in the Senate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: For whoever else in the Democratic Party stumbles upon this and has the instinct to progressively bracketize this, don't. Just make it a flat tax. Let's shift from a progressive income tax to a flat wealth gains tax. (Don't worry, the wealth distribution is already highly concentrated at the top.)

            <h3>If You Can't Do the Time, Then Don't Do the Crime</h3>
            <p>
              The extraordinarily wealthy want finance to feel complicated and inaccessible to ordinary people. But at the end of the day, it's just money moving around. We already track ordinary workers' incomes through W-4's for purposes of collecting income taxes. So any attempt for the wealthy to move their money around to avoid a wealth tax must have a clear paper trail â€” and if it doesn't, it starts looking less like tax avoidance and more like institutionalized money laundering.
            </p>
            <p>
              The go-to solution for cracking down on tax cheats seems to be increasing funding to the IRS. But instead of attempting to start a multi-billion-dollar arms race between the billionaires and the IRS, it would be far easier, cheaper, and effective to find a Senate parliamentarian that would allow for the imposition of a 6-month prison sentence for those who avoid the wealth gains tax, as that would not only be copacetic with the purpose of a budget resolution, but also directly increase revenues by reducing tax evasion. We should surely allow a bill that imposes new taxes to include mechanisms that can enforce the tax. Furthermore, there is no good reason why it is perfectly legal to enforce taxes by throwing billions of dollars at the IRS, but improper to enforce taxes by imposing a minimal prison penalty. Of course, in the case that this is adequately popular, we may be able to avoid the Byrd Rule entirely and send this through regular order.
            </p>
            <p>
              In either case, in the event such a tax law gets passed, this would place the onus on the Supreme Court if they wanted to make a ruling that would so obviously undermine the general welfare of the United States by revoking newfound economic freedom for millions of families to protect the unrealized wealth of a few billionaires.

            <h2 class="section top-margin" id="ubi">The Prosperity Dividend</h2>
            <h3>A Quarterly Robin-Hood-Powered Stimulus</h3>
            <p>
              The specific policy I'm envisioning is as follows: Every quarter, we reset the wealth basis of an individual's net worth. If the net worth increases over the quarter, the appreciation would be taxed at the wealth gains tax rate. If the net worth decreases, there would be no tax applied and no tax benefits for realizing a wealth loss. We would use <b>W-47 forms</b> to manage compliance with the tax (Why 47? Ask Mitt Romney ðŸ™‚). It would be beneficial to tie the wealth gains tax rate to the Consumer Price Index to combat price gouging. Also, with wealth being more volatile than W-4 income, it would make sense to use the tax revenue to fund stimulus checks to the bottom 99% on a quarterly basis instead of an income tax cut or tax credit. In this way, we can treat the wealth of the top 1% as a shared national endowment, where the bottom 99% can reinvest the dividends into their own lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, this means that the taxes will only be levied against those in the top 1% who get richer. So for those who are cynical about the billionaires' abilities to evade the tax, I'll say this: What if the easiest way for the wealth of the top 1% to decrease is for <b>the wealth to actually trickle down</b>? And if it doesn't trickle down, then we have this wealth gains tax that will force it to.
