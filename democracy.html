          <h1>Let's Save Democracy Now</h1>
          <h2>(Not in 2026 or 2028)</h2>
          <p>
            It is possible to force the House of Representatives to act on behalf of the people, not partisan politics. We have the power to tell our representatives to start a <b><u>discharge petition for a bill that we write and advocate for during the midterm election season</u></b> (not a thousand-page omnibus bill made behind closed doors). We would likely have to wait for the election season for the advocacy to make the most impact, since most people don't start paying attention to politics until the mainstream media tells them it's election time, but that shouldn't stop us from starting early to spread the word. There's also no need for an extensive political infrastructure to activate advocates; all we need are a bunch of people who can decide on a local level when and how to peacefully advocate for their congressional district. Maybe county-level Democratic Party organizers can take the lead on this instead of the DNC, who has failed our party for 10 years straight.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we can get a majority of representatives in the House to sign onto the petition, we can force the House to vote on the bill. Once it's on the floor of the House, we will see who is blocking it from passing. For all swamp creatures that vote Nay, we will organize! Local newspapers, write articles! Local radio stations, put them on blast! Local residents, flood the office with calls and emails, and get on the ground and organize! If we can get an <b><i>unvetoable majority</i></b> of representatives to vote in favor of the bill, then all representatives who voted in favor of the bill can do a <b><i>standing filibuster</i></b> and storm the Senate, not with zip-ties and violence, but instead with votes and voices. The House will not leave the Senate chamber until the bill receives an unvetoable majority of Senators to vote in favor. With overwhelming majorities of both chambers of Congress voting in favor of the bill, then that bill will become law, and President Trump will not be able to stop it! If the government will not do its job, then it is incumbent on us to instruct them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if we can't get an unvetoable majority, having a strong majority would make it politically difficult for the White House to reject the bill on contraian partisanism alone. It would be difficult to anyone to categorize it as a "liberal wish list" or that "no one knows what's in the bill." Furthermore, since all bills going through Congress are easily accessible online anyways through <a href="https://congress.gov" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a> or <a href="https://govtrack.us" target="_blank">GovTrack.us</a>, it would be extremely easy for anyone to verify that the official version circulating in the House of Representatives indeed matches the version of bill they're advocating for.

          <h2>We Can't Close Medical Centers Act (CCMC Act)</h2>
          <p>
            The first policy that I have in mind for this decentralized, national campaign is to rebuild our crumbling health infrastructure. The doctors, nurses, and health workers fought the virus on the frontlines for us during the pandemic, so it's time for us to return the favor by getting on the frontlines for our democracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crozer Chester Medical Center (CCMC) was a for-profit hospital in Chester County, PA that recently shut down because it is unprofitable to serve the poor. For poor, urban areas like Chester, as well as underserved rural areas around the country where it might take an hour to get to the nearest hospital, let's advocate for public funding for new hospitals that won't go out of business, or at the very least, restore disproportionate share funding for existing private hospitals that are under a lot of financial strain (think Obamacare subsidies, but for hospitals, not health insurance). And the wealthy will pay for it all -- not the high earners; the wealthy! This time, we're leaving no one behind - not the people in the inner city, and not the folks in countryside either. Americans don't leave Americans behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            This one is personal for me, since Crozer Chester Medical Center was the hospital that saved my life when my appendix was trying to kill me, and I received my first dose of the mRNA COVID vaccine at CCMC. And Crozer Psychiatry saved my life when I went through a terrible mental health crisis during the worst of the pandemic in late 2020. To me, it is unconscionable that we as a society can let this hospital that has dutifully served the community for years, especially through the pandemic, go out of business. And it is unacceptable for rural Americans to have no nearby hospitals in the case their son or daughter overdoses on drugs. Together, we can bridge the urban/rural divide and fight for a government that works for us, not themselves or their corporate cronies.
