          <h1>Let's Save Democracy Now</h1>
          <h2>(Not in 2026 or 2028)</h2>
          <p>It is possible to force the House of Representatives to act on behalf of the people, not partisan politics. We have the power to advocate for a <b><u>discharge petition</u></b> for a bill that <i>we</i> write (not a thousand-page omnibus bill made behind closed doors)</p>
          <p>If we can get a majority of representatives in the House to sign onto the petition, we can force the House to vote on the bill. Once it's on the floor of the House, we will see who is blocking it from passing. For all swamp creatures that vote Nay, we will organize! Local newspapers, write articles! Local radio stations, put them on blast! Local residents, flood the office with calls and emails, and get on the ground and organize! If we can get an <b><i>unvetoable majority</i></b> of representatives to vote in favor of the bill, then we can do a <b><i>standing filibuster</i></b> and storm the Senate (peacefully, of course). We’re <b>not</b> coming with zip-ties and violence — we’re coming with votes and voices. We will not leave the Senate chamber until the bill receives an unvetoable majority of Senators to vote in favor. With overwhelming majorities of both chambers of Congress voting in favor of the bill, then that bill will become law, <b>and President Trump can't stop us</b>! If the government will not do its job, then it is incumbent on us, We The People, to instruct them!</p>

          <p>The first policy that I have in mind for this decentralized, national campaign is to rebuild our crumbling health infrastructure. The doctors, nurses, and health workers fought the virus on the frontlines for us during the pandemic, so it's time for us to return the favor by getting on the frontlines for our democracy! This time, we're leaving no one behind - not the people in the inner city, and not the folks in countryside either. Americans don't leave Americans behind.</p>
          
          <h2>We Can't Close Medical Centers Act (CCMC Act)</h2>
          <p>Crozer Chester Medical Center (CCMC) was a for-profit hospital in Chester County, PA that recently shut down because it is unprofitable to serve the poor. For poor, urban areas like Chester, as well as underserved rural areas around the country where it might take an hour to get to the nearest hospital, let's advocate for public funding for new hospitals that won't go out of business, or at the very least, restore disproportionate share funding for existing private hospitals that are under a lot of financial strain. And the wealthy will pay for it all -- not the high earners; the wealthy!</p>
