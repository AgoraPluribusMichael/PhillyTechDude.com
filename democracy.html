          <h1>We Can and Must Save Democracy</h1>

        </header>

        <p>
          Donald Trump and his allies are now pushing an extreme legal doctrine called the <b>unitary executive
            theory</b>, which claims the president has total control over the entire executive branch ‚Äî including
          federal agencies and prosecutors. In practice, it's a <b>concerted effort to establish an American
            dictatorship</b> where the will of one man can override the will of Congress, the courts, and ultimately,
          the people. To save our democracy, <b>we must reverse this authoritarian concentration of power</b> and return
          the power to the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The best way we can save democracy is to actually be a democracy</b> instead of our current political
          oligarchy, where only Donald Trump and senior Democratic Party insiders have any control over the legislative
          agenda and political narrative, and corporate special interest groups wield the power of the pen to encode
          thousands of pages of dense legalese into law.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we already have a mechanism to realize the collective power of our voices: <b>the discharge petition</b>.
          And there are a few structural changes that can help us regain control of our government.

          <h3>Congress Must Do Its Damn Job and Check the Power of the President</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Donald Trump promised to be a dictator on day one ‚Äî and he's certainly governing like one. Backed by the
          far-right Project 2025 <b>unitary executive theory</b>, which claims that the president of the United States
          has total, unchecked authority over every agency in the Executive Branch, Donald Trump and Elon Musk have
          taken a sledgehammer to the very institutions that execute hundreds of invaluable government programs and
          services for millions of Americans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The administrative state ‚Äî which includes agencies like the Department of State, Department of Defense,
          Department of Education, and Social Security Administration ‚Äî is not a formally defined entity in the
          Constitution, but it has long functioned as the professional backbone of the federal government that executes
          the day-to-day governance, interpreting and implementing laws passed by Congress. In doing so, they serve as a
          quasi-check on the power of the president ‚Äî a de facto 4th branch of the government and a stabilizing force
          within the Executive Branch. What we're witnessing is that <b>Trump is trying to destroy the very part of the
            government that is specifically designed to execute the laws passed through Congress, which is a direct
            assault on our democracy</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, President Trump has imposed destructive tariffs on our allies around the world and authorized
          missile strikes against Iran without the consent of Congress. <b>These behaviors directly break fundamental
            laws that were established in the Constitution of the United States</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Article II, Section 3 states that one the president's duties is to <a
            href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-2/section-3/#:~:text=he%20shall%20take%20Care%20that%20the%20Laws%20be%20faithfully%20executed"
            target="_blank">take care that the laws be faithfully executed</a>. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution
          authorizes Congress to <a

          There is no amendment to the Constitution that altered the Take Care Clause in Article II, Section 3 or the
          Commerce Clause or War Powers Clause in Article I, Section 8. For this reason, it is <b>unconstitutional for
            Trump</b> to <b>gut the Social Security Administration</b>, <b>apply blanket tariffs</b> on our allies
          around the world, and <b>strike Iran without the consent of Congress</b>. It also follows that <b>Section 232
            of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 is unconstitutional</b>. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land,
          so <b>if the president breaks a constitutional law, then he has committed a high crime.</b> And <b>if breaking
            with the Constitution is not considered a high crime, then there is no such thing.</b>

            Publicizing the Writing of Laws</h2>
          <h3>If the Laws are Public, then the Sausage-Making Should Be Publicized</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Far too many laws are drafted behind closed doors ‚Äî not by elected officials, but by corporate lobbyists and
          special interest groups. These groups often shape legislation to serve their own agendas rather than the
          public good.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's time to shine a light up in there.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>We can fight back by establishing a Legislative State</b>: a legislative-branch counterpart to the
          administrative state. This new grassroots architecture would focus on legislation, funding, oversight, and
          policy design. The lawmaking would be done in a collaborative way that is open to the public through websites
          whose source code is free and open source.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we can create a decentralized group of citizens and lawmakers to collaboratively draft the legislation for
          Congress in a publicized, transparent manner, <b>we can invalidate the laws written by corrupt special
            interest
            groups and lobbyists</b> that rig the rules in their favor, and <b>we can create a bloc of highly-engaged voters
            that have influence over
            every congressional primary</b>. With the Legislative State, it would be understood that <b>the drafting and
            editing of all bills would be publicly visible before they can even be introduced in committee in
            Congress</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only would this make it easier for other lawmakers and the general public to vet the contents of the bills
          being written, but also make it harder for the special interest groups to secretly rig the rules in favor of
          their own interests at the expense of the American people.

          <h3>We the People Can Wield the Power of the Pen, Not Just the Politicians</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          It is possible to force the House of Representatives to act on behalf of the people, not partisan politics.
          <b>We have the power to tell our representatives to start a discharge petition for a bill that we write and
            advocate for during the midterm election season</b> This is the mechanism that the Legislative State can use
          to lobby Congress to pass laws made of by and for the people, not the corporations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>If we can get a majority of representatives in the House to sign onto the petition, we can force the House
            to vote on the bill.</b> Once it's on the floor of the House, we will see who is blocking it from passing.
          For all swamp creatures that vote Nay, we will organize! <b>Local newspapers</b>, write articles! <b>Local
            radio stations</b>, put them on blast! <b>Local residents</b>, flood the office with calls and emails, and
          get on the ground and organize! <b>If we can get an unvetoable majority of representatives to vote in favor of
            the bill, then the representatives can do a standing filibuster.</b> The House can storm the Senate ‚Äî not
          with zip-ties and violence, but instead with votes and voices ‚Äî and refuse to leave the Senate chamber until
          the bill receives an unvetoable majority of senators to vote in favor. <b>If we can pass a law that receives
            an unvetoable majority in both the House and the Senate, then it will become law</b>, regardless of what the
          White House wants. If the government will not do its job, then it is incumbent on us to do their job for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if we can't get an unvetoable majority, this process would make it politically difficult for the White
          House to reject the bill on partisan contrarianism alone. No one could characterize it as a "liberal wish
          list" or "extreme MAGA agenda" or claim that "no one knows what's in the bill." To the contrary, since all
          bills going through Congress
          are easily accessible online through <a href="https://congress.gov" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a> or <a
            href="https://govtrack.us" target="_blank">GovTrack.us</a>, <b>it would be extremely easy for anyone to
            verify that the official version circulating in the House of Representatives indeed matches the version of
            bill we're advocating for.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I reject the notion that the "sausage-making" of public laws can only be made from shady backroom deals in the
          Washington swamp and written by special interest groups and corporate entities who spew thousands of pages of
          dense legalese. To the contrary, I believe that most major bills should be collaboratively written out in the
          open and introduced through discharge petitions during election or activist campaigns. This would allow us to
          have real, productive conversations with the general public about the enormously consequential laws we're
          trying to pass as a nation. Furthermore, election season is when people are paying the most attention to
          politics. <b>Far more important than Beltway bipartisanship is for millions of Americans to engage,
            understand, and participate in the democratic process.</b> And even after the election, using discharge
          petitions for small, but substantive bills can help desegregate the House of Representatives, increase public
          engagement and transparency, and encourage any member of the House to present a winning idea, not just party
          leadership following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_rule" target="_blank">Hastert

        Hi! I'm Michael Yee, a software engineer, entrepreneur, music producer, and digital artist who lives in South Philly. After six years of working in the private sector, I quit my day job
        to launch my startup company Agora Pluribus Technologies, with the goal of using my sklls to empower ordinary
        people, because I want to be a part of the solution, not the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up
        waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world
        devolves into madness.
