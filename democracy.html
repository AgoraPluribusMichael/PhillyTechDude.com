            <h3>We the People Can Wield the Power of the Pen, Not Just the Politicians</h3>
            <p>
              It is possible to force the House of Representatives to act on behalf of the people, not partisan politics. We have the power to tell our representatives to start a <b><u>discharge petition for a bill that we write and advocate for during the midterm election season</u></b> (not a thousand-page omnibus bill made behind closed doors). We would likely have to wait for the election season to start for the advocacy to make the most impact, since most people don't start paying attention to politics until the mainstream media tells them it's election time, but that shouldn't stop us from starting early to spread the word. There's also no need for an extensive political infrastructure to activate advocates; all we need are a bunch of people who can decide on a local level when and how to peacefully advocate for their congressional district. Maybe county-level Democratic Party organizers can take the lead on this instead of the DNC, who has failed our party for 10 years straight.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we can get a majority of representatives in the House to sign onto the petition, we can force the House to vote on the bill. Once it's on the floor of the House, we will see who is blocking it from passing. For all swamp creatures that vote Nay, we will organize! Local newspapers, write articles! Local radio stations, put them on blast! Local residents, flood the office with calls and emails, and get on the ground and organize! If we can get an <b><i>unvetoable majority</i></b> of representatives to vote in favor of the bill, then all representatives who voted in favor of the bill can do a <b><i>standing filibuster</i></b> and storm the Senate, not with zip-ties and violence, but instead with votes and voices. The House will not leave the Senate chamber until the bill receives an unvetoable majority of Senators to vote in favor. With overwhelming majorities of both chambers of Congress voting in favor of the bill, then that bill will become law, and President Trump will not be able to stop it! If the government will not do its job, then it is incumbent on us to do their job for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if we can't get an unvetoable majority, this process would make it politically difficult for the White House to reject the bill on contrarian partisanism alone. It would be difficult to anyone to characterize it as a "liberal wish list" or claim that "no one knows what's in the bill." To the contrary, since all bills going through Congress are easily accessible online through <a href="https://congress.gov" target="_blank">Congress.gov</a> or <a href="https://govtrack.us" target="_blank">GovTrack.us</a>, it would be extremely easy for anyone to verify that the official version circulating in the House of Representatives indeed matches the version of bill we're advocating for.
            </p>
            <p>
              I reject the notion that the "sausage-making" of public laws can only be made from shady backroom deals in the Washington swamp and written by special interest groups and corporate entities who spew thousands of pages of dense legalese. To the contrary, I believe that most major bills should be done through discharge petitions during election campaigns. Not only would that work to desegregate the House of Representatives, but allow us to have real, productive conversations with the general public about the enormously consequential laws we're trying to pass as a nation. Far more important than Beltway bipartisanship is for millions of Americans to engage, understand, and participate in the democratic process.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, the best way we can save democracy is to <b>actually be a democracy</b> instead of our current political oligarchy, where only Donald Trump and senior Democratic Party insiders have any control over the legislative agenda and political narrative, and only corporate special interest groups have the power of the pen.

            <h3>Let's Fight On the Frontlines To Revitalize Our Failing Health System</h3>
            <p>
              The first policy that I have in mind for this decentralized, national campaign is to rebuild our crumbling health infrastructure. The doctors, nurses, and health workers fought the virus on the frontlines for us during the pandemic, so it's time for us to return the favor by getting on the frontlines for our democracy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crozer Chester Medical Center (CCMC) was a for-profit hospital in Chester County, PA that recently shut down because it is unprofitable to serve the poor. For poor, urban areas like Chester, as well as under-served rural areas around the country where it might take an hour to get to the nearest hospital, let's advocate for public funding for new hospitals that won't go out of business, or at the very least, restore disproportionate share funding for existing private hospitals that are under a lot of financial strain (think Obamacare subsidies, but for hospitals, not health insurance). And the wealthy will pay for it all ‚Äî not the high earners; the wealthy! This time, we're leaving no one behind ‚Äî not the people in the inner city, and not the folks in countryside either. Americans don't leave Americans behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              This one is personal for me, since Crozer Chester Medical Center was the hospital that saved my life when my appendix was trying to kill me, and it is also where I received my first dose of the mRNA COVID vaccine. Crozer Psychiatry saved my life when I went through a terrible mental health crisis during the worst of the pandemic in late 2020. To me, it is unconscionable that we as a society can let this hospital that has dutifully served the community for years, especially through the pandemic, go out of business. And it is unacceptable for rural Americans to have no nearby hospitals in the case their son or daughter overdoses on drugs. Together, we can bridge the urban/rural divide and fight for a government that works for us, not themselves or their corporate cronies.

              I'm a 28-year-old software engineer living in South Philly who is considering running for office in 2026 to represent PA-03 in Congress, because I'm tired of writing code designed to make the rich people richer by harming our society, and I would instead prefer to advocate for and write laws to help serve the common good.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world devolves into madness.
