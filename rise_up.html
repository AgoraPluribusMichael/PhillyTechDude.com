          It feels like the world is spiraling out of control ‚Äî politically, economically, and socially. Democracies are
          being tested, dictators are gaining power, economic uncertainty is rising, and social trust is deteriorating.
          With violent insurrections, crackdowns on dissent, aggressive military campaigns, and sweeping tariffs that
          have devastated the economic security of millions ‚Äî we are witnessing a global wave of authoritarianism.
        </p>
        <p>
          At home, public trust in our politicians and political institutions is eroding. Corporate entities and special
          interest groups lobby our politicians to rig the laws to serve their interests at the expense of the American
          public. Career political insiders suppress dissenting opinions and speech from within their own parties to
          maintain control over the agenda and the narrative. The cable news media and social media algorithms amplify
          lies and outrage. And the authoritarian consolidation of power in the government chips away at the foundation
          of our democracy. On the whole, the message is clear: the people aren't meant to be in control.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that's exactly what they want us to believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In a democracy, millions of ordinary people have the power to control our government</b>. Many wars have
          been fought
          over the right for citizens to rule themselves, not to be ruled over by kings and dictators. <b>The
            authoritarians win by convincing you that you are powerless</b>, flooding you with fear,
          uncertainty, doubt, and outrage. But there is no authoritarian power in the entire world that can control what
          you do or say, especially if you live in America. Once we <b>stop thinking about what <i>they</i> are doing
            and instead focus on <i>what we can do</i></b> through the peaceful democratic process, we can begin to flip
          the power dynamic and regain control of our democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in the bleakest moments, we must always remember that we can rise above oppression. Just as the
          abolitionists ended slavery, the suffragists secured voting rights for women, and the civil rights activists
          ended segregation, <b>we, too, must meet the moment to rise above the creeping authoritarianism that
            weaponizes fear and frustration to erode our democracy and steal our fundamental right to govern
            ourselves</b>.

          <h2 class="section-header" id="societal-pessimism">Extremism, Conspiracies, and Vigilantism Are Symptoms of a
            Broader Problem</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Shortly after the 2024 election, a lone wolf vigilante <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Brian_Thompson" target="_blank">murdered the CEO of a private
            health insurance company in broad daylight on the streets of New York City</a>, which I strongly condemn,
          especially when <b>there exist perfectly peaceful and legal ways to reform the health insurance industry</b>.
          But this reflects a broader phenomenon: if government and proper authorities fail to act, then there is a risk
          for vigilantes to come out of the woodwork and pursue their own version of "justice." In this way, I
          view vigilantism as more than just aberrant criminal behavior ‚Äî it's a policy failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking more broadly, this behavior fits into a troubling pattern. <b>Even those who are firmly within the
            American mainstream can drift toward third-party ideologies, conspiracy theories, or even violence when they
            no longer believe the system is capable of delivering justice</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the pandemic, there was a huge spike in conspiratorial thinking. I think it has to do with this
          overwhelming and unbearable feeling of fear and helplessness. Everything shut down, and people were dying by
          the thousands, and the government bungled its response to the pandemic.
          In fact, my own mental health took a dire turn at the time, and I started to look outside the mainstream for
          solutions to defuse our toxic and contentious political culture. And for a few months, my mental health was at
          an all-time low, and I became a big believer in voluntary taxation. Luckily for me, four years of care from <a
            href="unite_the_states.html#heal-the-divide" target="_blank">Crozer Psychiatry</a> and therapy across
          several mental health providers allowed my mental health to make a full recovery. (And as for the voluntary
          taxation,
          <a href="new_globalism.html#societal-bond-fund" target="_blank">some things never change</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>While the politically disaffected differ widely in platform and tone, they often share a
            common trait: the loss of faith in our major political parties and our institutions to address a
            systemic injustice</b>. Anarchists have lost faith in the government, ecosocialists have lost faith in the
          economy, and populists have lost faith in the establishment. And while third-party policies tend towards the
          extreme, regressive, or unrealistic, they are at least grounded in a real criticism of the system and are
          constructive in nature, as they attempt to enact positive change through our existing political and legal
          democratic process. And it helps that they can commiserate together instead of retreating into total isolation
          from the broader public. But still, <b>it is a stinging indictment of the duopoly and a symptom of gross
            incompetence and negligence for some people to be searching outside the mainstream for <i>something</i> to
            fix the problem</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that <b>some people tend to look to conspiracies, because they would rather believe that
            <i>someone</i> is in
            control than to believe that everyone is helpless</b> ‚Äî that there must be a network of shadowy, nefarious
          figures that have corrupted the government and pull the strings behind the scenes to oppress the masses,
          preventing even the most good-hearted and powerful politicians from addressing systemic injustices. For a
          widow who was supposed to retire in a few years and travel the world with her husband, but instead lost him to
          COVID-19, it's only natural for her to be desperately searching for a <i>reason</i>, for <i>someone</i> to be
          behind all this.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the whole, this can form a negative feedback loop, as the extreme third-party policies and bizarre
          conspiracy theories can be so off-putting to the general public, that it can result in chronic isolation,
          delusion, and despair. There are some who stew for long enough in a place of unbearable desperation, that they
          eventually feel the need to lash out through violent individual action, either directed outwardly (mass
          shootings, murders, acts of terror) or inwardly (addiction, self harm, suicide, deaths of despair) ‚Äî the
          tragic and natural outcome of a <b>complete loss of faith in any institution, system, or legal means to
            achieve justice</b>. This is my assessment for how someone who was previously a happy and productive member
          of society could end up murdering a health insurance CEO on the streets of New York City.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, I view extremism, despair, cynicism, isolation, and vigilante violence as symptoms of existential
          and systemic societal rot, which paves the way for oppressive "strong-man" authoritarianism to fill the void
          where everyone else has failed. That's why I believe that <b>the widespread loss of faith in our society is
            the biggest policy failure of our time</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way I can think of to combat this trend is to inspire people, on an individual level, to realize
          their capabilities to make a positive change through peaceful and legal means. When people believe they have
          the power to shape the system, they don't try to burn it down or base their entire worldview around how "they"
          have all the power. And while it is definitely not easy, <b>it is possible to leverage existing power
            structures and legal procedures to be the change we want to see</b>.

          I recently changed my party affiliation to Independent after 10 years straight of being a partisan Democratic
          voter and small-dollar donor. The evidence is clear; the neoliberal Democratic
          Party leaders have utterly failed to meet the moment. And while I remain liberal, I would now consider
          myself a Bull Moose liberal (a populist live-and-let-live progressive capitalist) instead of a partisan
          neoliberal apologist. Simply put, I no longer trust "the experts" on Capitol Hill to save democracy, because
          I've realized when they say "save democracy," they really mean "save our status within the Party while
          presiding over the destruction of democracy."
        </p>
        <p>
          While I lean liberal, I fully believe that it is possible to learn something from just about anyone. And for
          the longest time, I never understood this video from Jocko Willink, a conservative leadership expert and former Navy SEAL.
        </p>

        <p>
          But now, this video is core to my belief on how we can best defeat authoritarianism in America. It takes each
          and every one of us, on an individual level, to believe in our own capabilities and do what we can to be a
          part of the solution. <b>We are not experts, but we are also not helpless</b>. Once we start realizing how
          much <b>agency we have in our own minds and bodies</b>, it becomes abundantly clear that <b>even the most
            fearsome authoritarian forces on Earth are nowhere near as powerful as they want you to believe</b>. While
          we can't control what those nefarious dark forces are doing to try to control the narrative and pull the
          strings behind the scenes, we must <b>reject the victim mentality, and be the change we want to see in the
            world</b>. So let's channel our anger towards productive and constructive organizing, not cynicism,
          extremism, violence, or despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock says, <a
            href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/raphael-warnock-full-victory-speech-transcript#:~:text=Voting%20is%20faith%20put%20into%20action"
            target="_blank">"Voting is faith put into action."</a> <b>Democracy is not an identity that we maintain by
          voting for politicians. Democracy is the idea that we can use the agency we have</b> in our lips and legs, our hands and
          feet, and our heads
          and hearts <b>to govern ourselves, not be ruled over by kings and dictators</b>. Not any one of us can save our
          democracy alone, but together, we can be unstoppable.
          Together, we can rise up against the fear, uncertainty, doubt, and outrage. We can defeat the suppressive
          learned helplessness from the fascist corporate elites and foreign authoritarian forces who are trying to hold
          us down. We can fight to save our democracy, powered by the optimism we have in our own capabilities and
          desires for a better future. We can write and become the narrative that rises above the oppression to realize
          our
          capacity to become a nation of free will ‚Äî that shining democracy on a hill ‚Äî and make it through even the
          darkest times to brighter and better days ahead.

        Hi! I'm Michael Yee, a software engineer, entrepreneur, music producer, and digital artist who lives in South
        Philly. After six years of working in the private sector, I quit my day job
        to launch my startup company Agora Pluribus Technologies, with the goal of using my sklls to empower ordinary
        people, because I want to be a part of the solution, not the problem.

        I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up
        waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world
        devolves into madness.
