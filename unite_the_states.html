        </header>
        <p>
          As our politics has become increasingly polarized, it has been harder to find consensus on Capitol Hill to
          address our country's most pressing national issues. For this reason, I am proposing we investigate ways to
          pass bills that returns politics to the state and local level instead of being subjected to the whims of the
          toxic national partisan political environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          One strategy that I have in mind would be to use <b>interstate compacts</b> (<a
            href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-10/#:~:text=enter%20into%20any%20Agreement%20or%20Compact%20with%20another%20State"
            target="_blank">Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution</a>) to create legally binding agreements among
          like-minded states that can serve as a workaround to national partisan gridlock. With enough political will,
          these compacts can allow the states to collaborate on pressing issues, even when Congress is paralyzed on the
          national level.

            Funding Hospitals</h2>
          <h3>From Philadelphia to Appalachia, Let's Heal the Divide!</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The pandemic put our public health system under enormous strain. Even today, private hospitals all around the
          country are struggling to stay afloat. <b>The doctors, nurses, and health workers fought the virus on the
            frontlines for us during the pandemic, so it's time for us to return the favor by getting on the frontlines
            revitalize our failing health system.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Crozer Chester Medical Center (CCMC) was a for-profit hospital in Chester County, PA that recently shut down
          because it is more profitable to dismantle an entire health system than it is to serve the poor. For
          impoverished urban areas like Chester, as well as under-served rural areas around the country where it might
          take an hour to get to the nearest hospital, <b>let's advocate for public funding to revitalize our hospital
            system</b>. We can fight to build new public hospitals and restore disproportionate share funding for
          existing private hospitals (think Obamacare subsidies, but for hospitals, not health insurance). And <b>who
            will foot the bill? The very people who profit by undermining our public health.</b> The wealthy will pay
          for it all ‚Äî <a href="taxes.html" target="_blank">not the high earners; the wealthy!</a> This time, we're
          leaving no one behind ‚Äî not the people in the inner city, and not the folks in countryside either. Americans
          don't leave Americans behind. <b>Let's Heal the Divide!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This one is personal for me, since Crozer Chester Medical Center was the hospital that saved my life when my
          appendix was trying to kill me, and it is also where I received my first dose of the mRNA COVID vaccine.
          Crozer Psychiatry saved my life when I went through a terrible mental health crisis during the worst of the
          pandemic in late 2020. To me, <b>it is unconscionable for our society to let this hospital that has dutifully
            served the community for years, go out of business</b>, especially one that helped us survive the pandemic.
          And <b>it is unacceptable for rural Americans to have no nearby hospitals in the case their son or daughter
            overdoses on drugs</b>. Together, we can bridge the urban/rural divide and fight for a government that works
          for us, not themselves or their corporate cronies.

        <p>
          The idea would be to coordinate among the 26 or so states that allow for citizen-initiated ballot initiatives
          to form and join an interstate compact, wherein member states are expected to implement a <b>statewide
            split-rate tax</b> and <b>lower the state income tax rate to negative 1%</b>. (Georgism is based!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, there would be a <b>14th Amendment fiscal sanity provision</b> that advises each member state to
          implement an emergency split-rate tax in the event to bail out the federal government if it defaults on the
          national debt or refuses to disburse Social Security or other benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          For states like Pennsylvania, where us grug-brained simpletons cannot initiate a ballot referendum‚Ä¶ Well,
          maybe we just need a cooperative State House, State Senate, and Governor that would allow us to join the
          compact.

        </header>
        <p>
          Let's establish a compact among states to agree to <b>implement a public option for health insurance</b>. This
          would be very similar to what Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz proposed in his <a
            href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4063" target="_blank">State Public Option
            Act</a>, except it would be in the form of authorizing the creation of an interstate compact, with no
          initial member states. States would join the compact either through citizen-initiated ballot measure or
          directly by state governments.

        <p>
          Let's establish an interstate compact designed to guide state-level governance to protect American consumers
          from corporate exploitation. Together, we can <b>cap credit card interchange fees and interest rates, protect
            the right to repair, eliminate the proliferation of microplastics and carcinogens, reduce landfill waste,
            and punish corporations for outsourcing jobs.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if not all states participate, a coalition of populous blue states (I'm thinking California, plus others)
          can force the corporations to play by the rules if they want to be competitive in American markets. Let's ban
          corporations from harming our society for profit.

          <h3>A Constitutional Argument</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          As a Philadelphian who works across the border in Delaware, not only do I have to travel longer distances to
          get to work, which means I pay more in gas and time, but also I pay more in taxes, too, because I get taxed at
          the Delaware state income tax rates, with the highest marginal rate at 6.6%, instead of Pennsylvania's flat
          3.07% rate. And furthermore, none of those taxes go to Pennsylvania. It all goes to Delaware. And the Delaware
          state government knows this full well, and this is the reason why we have not had a reciprocity agreement
          between our states. It's because Delaware likes the free money off the backs of working Philadelphians. It is
          beyond unfair for Philadelphians to pay more in taxes just because we work across the border. Why should we
          pay more in taxes than someone working a similar job in Harrisburg?
        </p>
        <p>
          It's even unconstitutional, in violation of the <a
            href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#4-2:~:text=The%20Citizens%20of%20each%20State%20shall%20be%20entitled%20to%20all%20Privileges%20and%20Immunities%20of%20Citizens%20in%20the%20several%20States."
            target="_blank">Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, Section 2</a> of the Constitution, which
          guarantees that <b>citizens of one state cannot be unfairly burdened by another</b>.

          maxing out tax-deferred contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and/or HSA.

        Hi! I'm Michael Yee, a software engineer who lives in South Philly. After six years of working in the private sector, I quit my day job
        to launch my startup company Agora Pluribus Technologies, with the goal of using my sklls to empower ordinary
        people, because I want to be a part of the solution, not the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never formally studied law, public policy, or political science; I'm just a guy who lives here, and I'm fed up
        waiting for the next big establishment Democratic politician to save us from Trump while the whole world
        devolves into madness.
